Thank you Andy. I am pleased to be here today. This event provides a great opportunity to address a topic that is the subject of considerable debate in the press and in the crypto-community -- whether a digital asset offered as a security can, over time, become something other than a security.

To start, we should frame the question differently and focus not on the digital asset itself, but on the circumstances surrounding the digital asset and the manner in which it is sold. To that end, a better line of inquiry is: “Can a digital asset that was originally offered in a securities offering ever be later sold in a manner that does not constitute an offering of a security?” In cases where the digital asset represents a set of rights that gives the holder a financial interest in an enterprise, the answer is likely “no.” In these cases, calling the transaction an initial coin offering, or “ICO,” or a sale of a “token,” will not take it out of the purview of the U.S. securities laws.

But what about cases where there is no longer any central enterprise being invested in or where the digital asset is sold only to be used to purchase a good or service available through the network on which it was created? I believe in these cases the answer is a qualified “yes.” I would like to share my thinking with you today about the circumstances under which that could occur.

Before I turn to the securities law analysis, let me share what I believe may be most exciting about distributed ledger technology -- that is, the potential to share information, transfer value, and record transactions in a decentralized digital environment. Potential applications include supply chain management, intellectual property rights licensing, stock ownership transfers and countless others. There is real value in creating applications that can be accessed and executed electronically with a public, immutable record and without the need for a trusted third party to verify transactions. Some people believe that this technology will transform e-commerce as we know it. There is excitement and a great deal of speculative interest around this new technology. Unfortunately, there also are cases of fraud. In many regards, it is still “early days.”

But I am not here to discuss the promise of technology -- there are many in attendance and speaking here today that can do a much better job of that. I would like to focus on the application of the federal securities laws to digital asset transactions -- that is how tokens and coins are being issued, distributed and sold. While perhaps a bit dryer than the promise of the blockchain, this topic is critical to the broader acceptance and use of these novel instruments.

I will begin by describing what I often see. Promoters, in order to raise money to develop networks on which digital assets will operate, often sell the tokens or coins rather than sell shares, issue notes or obtain bank financing. But, in many cases, the economic substance is the same as a conventional securities offering. Funds are raised with the expectation that the promoters will build their system and investors can earn a return on the instrument -- usually by selling their tokens in the secondary market once the promoters create something of value with the proceeds and the value of the digital enterprise increases.

When we see that kind of economic transaction, it is easy to apply the Supreme Court's “investment contract” test first announced in SEC v. Howey. That test requires an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others. And it is important to reflect on the facts of Howey. A hotel operator sold interests in a citrus grove to its guests and claimed it was selling real estate, not securities. While the transaction was recorded as a real estate sale, it also included a service contract to cultivate and harvest the oranges. The purchasers could have arranged to service the grove themselves but, in fact, most were passive, relying on the efforts of Howey-in-the-Hills Service, Inc. for a return. In articulating the test for an investment contract, the Supreme Court stressed: “Form [is] disregarded for substance and the emphasis [is] placed upon economic reality.” So the purported real estate purchase was found to be an investment contract -- an investment in orange groves was in these circumstances an investment in a security.

Just as in the Howey case, tokens and coins are often touted as assets that have a use in their own right, coupled with a promise that the assets will be cultivated in a way that will cause them to grow in value, to be sold later at a profit. And, as in Howey -- where interests in the groves were sold to hotel guests, not farmers -- tokens and coins typically are sold to a wide audience rather than to persons who are likely to use them on the network.

In the ICOs I have seen, overwhelmingly, promoters tout their ability to create an innovative application of blockchain technology. Like in Howey, the investors are passive. Marketing efforts are rarely narrowly targeted to token users. And typically at the outset, the business model and very viability of the application is still uncertain. The purchaser usually has no choice but to rely on the efforts of the promoter to build the network and make the enterprise a success. At that stage, the purchase of a token looks a lot like a bet on the success of the enterprise and not the purchase of something used to exchange for goods or services on the network.

As an aside, you might ask, given that these token sales often look like securities offerings, why are the promoters choosing to package the investment as a coin or token offering? This is an especially good question if the network on which the token or coin will function is not yet operational. I think there can be a number of reasons. For a while, some believed such labeling might, by itself, remove the transaction from the securities laws. I think people now realize labeling an investment opportunity as a coin or token does not achieve that result. Second, this labeling might have been used to bring some marketing “sizzle” to the enterprise. That might still work to some extent, but the track record of ICOs is still being sorted out and some of that sizzle may now be more of a potential warning flare for investors.

Some may be attracted to a blockchain-mediated crowdfunding process. Digital assets can represent an efficient way to reach a global audience where initial purchasers have a stake in the success of the network and become part of a network where their participation adds value beyond their investment contributions. The digital assets are then exchanged -- for some, to help find the market price for the new application; for others, to speculate on the venture. As I will discuss, whether a transaction in a coin or token on the secondary market amounts to an offer or sale of a security requires a careful and fact-sensitive legal analysis.

I believe some industry participants are beginning to realize that, in some circumstances, it might be easier to start a blockchain-based enterprise in a more conventional way. In other words, conduct the initial funding through a registered or exempt equity or debt offering and, once the network is up and running, distribute or offer blockchain-based tokens or coins to participants who need the functionality the network and the digital assets offer. This allows the tokens or coins to be structured and offered in a way where it is evident that purchasers are not making an investment in the development of the enterprise.

Returning to the ICOs I am seeing, strictly speaking, the token -- or coin or whatever the digital information packet is called -- all by itself is not a security, just as the orange groves in Howey were not. Central to determining whether a security is being sold is how it is being sold and the reasonable expectations of purchasers. When someone buys a housing unit to live in, it is probably not a security. But under certain circumstances, the same asset can be offered and sold in a way that causes investors to have a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others. For example, if the housing unit is offered with a management contract or other services, it can be a security. Similarly, when a CD, exempt from being treated as a security under Section 3 of the Securities Act, is sold as a part of a program organized by a broker who offers retail investors promises of liquidity and the potential to profit from changes in interest rates, the Gary Plastic case teaches us that the instrument can be part of an investment contract that is a security.

The same reasoning applies to digital assets. The digital asset itself is simply code. But the way it is sold -- as part of an investment; to non-users; by promoters to develop the enterprise -- can be, and, in that context, most often is, a security -- because it evidences an investment contract. And regulating these transactions as securities transactions makes sense. The impetus of the Securities Act is to remove the information asymmetry between promoters and investors. In a public distribution, the Securities Act prescribes the information investors need to make an informed investment decision, and the promoter is liable for material misstatements in the offering materials. These are important safeguards, and they are appropriate for most ICOs. The disclosures required under the federal securities laws nicely complement the Howey investment contract element about the efforts of others. As an investor, the success of the enterprise -- and the ability to realize a profit on the investment -- turns on the efforts of the third party. So learning material information about the third party -- its background, financing, plans, financial stake and so forth -- is a prerequisite to making an informed investment decision. Without a regulatory framework that promotes disclosure of what the third party alone knows of these topics and the risks associated with the venture, investors will be uninformed and are at risk.

But this also points the way to when a digital asset transaction may no longer represent a security offering. If the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized -- where purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts -- the assets may not represent an investment contract. Moreover, when the efforts of the third party are no longer a key factor for determining the enterprise's success, material information asymmetries recede. As a network becomes truly decentralized, the ability to identify an issuer or promoter to make the requisite disclosures becomes difficult, and less meaningful.

And so, when I look at Bitcoin today, I do not see a central third party whose efforts are a key determining factor in the enterprise. The network on which Bitcoin functions is operational and appears to have been decentralized for some time, perhaps from inception. Applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to the offer and resale of Bitcoin would seem to add little value. And putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. And, as with Bitcoin, applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to current transactions in Ether would seem to add little value. Over time, there may be other sufficiently decentralized networks and systems where regulating the tokens or coins that function on them as securities may not be required. And of course there will continue to be systems that rely on central actors whose efforts are a key to the success of the enterprise. In those cases, application of the securities laws protects the investors who purchase the tokens or coins.

I would like to emphasize that the analysis of whether something is a security is not static and does not strictly inhere to the instrument. Even digital assets with utility that function solely as a means of exchange in a decentralized network could be packaged and sold as an investment strategy that can be a security. If a promoter were to place Bitcoin in a fund or trust and sell interests, it would create a new security. Similarly, investment contracts can be made out of virtually any asset (including virtual assets), provided the investor is reasonably expecting profits from the promoter's efforts.

Let me emphasize an earlier point: simply labeling a digital asset a “utility token” does not turn the asset into something that is not a security. I recognize that the Supreme Court has acknowledged that if someone is purchasing an asset for consumption only, it is likely not a security. But, the economic substance of the transaction always determines the legal analysis, not the labels. The oranges in Howey had utility. Or in my favorite example, the Commission warned in the late 1960s about investment contracts sold in the form of whisky warehouse receipts. Promoters sold the receipts to U.S. investors to finance the aging and blending processes of Scotch whisky. The whisky was real -- and, for some, had exquisite utility. But Howey was not selling oranges and the warehouse receipts promoters were not selling whisky for consumption. They were selling investments, and the purchasers were expecting a return from the promoters' efforts.

Promoters and other market participants need to understand whether transactions in a particular digital asset involve the sale of a security. We are happy to help promoters and their counsel work through these issues. We stand prepared to provide more formal interpretive or no-action guidance about the proper characterization of a digital asset in a proposed use. In addition, we recognize that there are numerous implications under the federal securities laws of a particular asset being considered a security. For example, our Divisions of Trading and Markets and Investment Management are focused on such issues as broker-dealer, exchange and fund registration, as well as matters of market manipulation, custody and valuation. We understand that market participants are working to make their services compliant with the existing regulatory framework, and we are happy to continue our engagement in this process.

What are some of the factors to consider in assessing whether a digital asset is offered as an investment contract and is thus a security? Primarily, consider whether a third party -- be it a person, entity or coordinated group of actors -- drives the expectation of a return. That question will always depend on the particular facts and circumstances, and this list is illustrative, not exhaustive:

    . Is there a person or group that has sponsored or promoted the creation and sale of the digital asset, the efforts of whom play a significant role in the development and maintenance of the asset and its potential increase in value?
    . Has this person or group retained a stake or other interest in the digital asset such that it would be motivated to expend efforts to cause an increase in value in the digital asset? Would purchasers reasonably believe such efforts will be undertaken and may result in a return on their investment in the digital asset?
    . Has the promoter raised an amount of funds in excess of what may be needed to establish a functional network, and, if so, has it indicated how those funds may be used to support the value of the tokens or to increase the value of the enterprise? Does the promoter continue to expend funds from proceeds or operations to enhance the functionality and/or value of the system within which the tokens operate?
    . Are purchasers “investing,” that is seeking a return? In that regard, is the instrument marketed and sold to the general public instead of to potential users of the network for a price that reasonably correlates with the market value of the good or service in the network?
    . Does application of the Securities Act protections make sense? Is there a person or entity others are relying on that plays a key role in the profit-making of the enterprise such that disclosure of their activities and plans would be important to investors? Do informational asymmetries exist between the promoters and potential purchasers/investors in the digital asset?
    . Do persons or entities other than the promoter exercise governance rights or meaningful influence?

While these factors are important in analyzing the role of any third party, there are contractual or technical ways to structure digital assets so they function more like a consumer item and less like a security. Again, we would look to the economic substance of the transaction, but promoters and their counsels should consider these, and other, possible features. This list is not intended to be exhaustive and by no means do I believe each and every one of these factors needs to be present to establish a case that a token is not being offered as a security. This list is meant to prompt thinking by promoters and their counsel, and start the dialogue with the staff -- it is not meant to be a list of all necessary factors in a legal analysis.

. Is token creation commensurate with meeting the needs of users or, rather, with feeding speculation?
. Are independent actors setting the price or is the promoter supporting the secondary market for the asset or otherwise influencing trading?
. Is it clear that the primary motivation for purchasing the digital asset is for personal use or consumption, as compared to investment? Have purchasers made representations as to their consumptive, as opposed to their investment, intent? Are the tokens available in increments that correlate with a consumptive versus investment intent?
. Are the tokens distributed in ways to meet users' needs? For example, can the tokens be held or transferred only in amounts that correspond to a purchaser's expected use? Are there built-in incentives that compel using the tokens promptly on the network, such as having the tokens degrade in value over time, or can the tokens be held for extended periods for investment?
. Is the asset marketed and distributed to potential users or the general public?
. Are the assets dispersed across a diverse user base or concentrated in the hands of a few that can exert influence over the application?
. Is the application fully functioning or in early stages of development?


These are exciting legal times and I am pleased to be part of a process that can help promoters of this new technology and their counsel navigate and comply with the federal securities laws.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE +
2022-134 +
Washington D.C., Aug. 1, 2022 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged 11 individuals for their roles in creating and promoting Forsage, a fraudulent crypto pyramid and Ponzi scheme that raised more than $300 million from millions of retail investors worldwide, including in the United States. Those charged include the four founders of Forsage, who were last known to be living in Russia, the Republic of Georgia, and Indonesia, as well as three U.S.-based promoters engaged by the founders to endorse Forsage on its website and social media platforms, and several members of the so-called Crypto Crusaders—the largest promotional group for the scheme that operated in the United States from at least five different states.

According to the SEC's complaint, in January 2020, Vladimir Okhotnikov, Jane Doe a/k/a Lola Ferrari, Mikhail Sergeev, and Sergey Maslakov launched Forsage.io, a website that allowed millions of retail investors to enter into transactions via smart contracts that operated on the Ethereum, Tron, and Binance blockchains. However, Forsage allegedly has operated as a pyramid scheme for more than two years, in which investors earned profits by recruiting others into the scheme.  Forsage also allegedly used assets from new investors to pay earlier investors in a typical Ponzi structure.

Despite cease-and-desist actions against Forsage for operating as a fraud in September 2020 by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines and in March 2021 by the Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance, the defendants allegedly continued to promote the scheme while denying the claims in several YouTube videos and by other means.

"As the complaint alleges, Forsage is a fraudulent pyramid scheme launched on a massive scale and aggressively marketed to investors," said Carolyn Welshhans, Acting Chief of the SEC's Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. "Fraudsters cannot circumvent the federal securities laws by focusing their schemes on smart contracts and blockchains."

In addition to charging the four founders, the complaint, filed in United States District Court in the Northern District of Illinois, also charges Cheri Beth Bowen, of Pelahatchie, Miss., Ronald R. Deering, of Coeur d’ Alene, Idaho, Samuel D. Ellis, of Louisville, Ky., Mark F. Hamlin, of Henrico, Va., Carlos L. Martinez, of Chicago, Ill., Alisha R. Shepperd, of Dunedin, Fla., and Sarah L. Theissen, of Hartford, Wis., with violating the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC's complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil penalties.

Without admitting or denying the allegations, two of the defendants, Ellis and Theissen, agreed to settle the charges and to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the charged provisions and certain other activity. Additionally, Ellis agreed to pay disgorgement and civil penalties, and Theissen will be required to pay disgorgement and civil penalties as determined by the court. Both settlements are subject to court approval.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Liz Canizares and Pamela Sawhney of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and supervised by Amy Friedman and Ms. Welshhans. The litigation is being conducted by Patrick Costello, Christopher Carney, Ms. Canizares, and Ms. Sawhney and supervised by Olivia Choe. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines and the Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance.

[underline]#**MEMORANDUM AND ORDER**#

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contends that LBRY, Inc. offered and sold unregistered securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. LBRY responds that it does not need to comply with the Securities Act because its alleged security, a blockchain token called LBC, is not a security at all. Instead, it argues that LBC functions as a digital currency that is an essential component of the LBRY Blockchain. LBRY also a sserts that the SEC's attempt to treat LBC as a security violates its right to due process because the agency did not give LBRY fair notice that its offerings of LBC are subject to the securities laws. The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment addressing both issues

.	[underline]#**BACKGROUND**# +
The nascent technology known as blockchain operates in the background of this dispute. From its earliest days, proponents of blockchain technology have envisioned it as fundamentally altering many aspects of modern life. See Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (2008), https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf[] (outlining the idea for a peer-topeer electronic payment system). As LBRY explains, a blockchain is essentially a “decentralized ledger maintained by a network of independently owned computers.” See Kauffman Decl., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Doc. No. 61-3] at 2 ¶ 5. Verified data is held in decentralized “block[s]” linked together via cryptographic consensus protocols. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[id.] at 2 ¶ 9. New data is connected to previous blocks, forming a chain. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[id.] at 2 ¶ 6. Digital tokens are used to compensate “miners” who validate transactions and allow for peer-to-peer “transfers of value,” which are then logged in the decentralized ledger.

.. The Development of the LBRY Network + 
 	LBRY began as an effort to harness blockchain technology to allow users to share videos, images, and other digital content without a centralized host such as YouTube. [underline]#See# Def.'s Mem., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791680[Doc. No. 61-1] at 3. LBRY asserts that its LBRY Network is “the first decentralized, open-source, fully encrypted content distribution service built using the same blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin.” [underline]#See# Introducing LBRY: The Bitcoin of Content, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791688[Doc. No. 61-9] at 1. The LBRY Network is comprised of three components: “(1) the LBRY Blockchain, (2) the LBRY Data Network, and (3) the applications layer[.]” Kauffman Decl., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Doc.

It is used to compensate miners, but it can also be spent on the LBRY Blockchain to publish content, create “channel[s]” that associate content with a single user, tip content creators, purchase paywall content, or “boost[]” channels or content in search results. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[id.] at 5-6 ¶ 17.

 	The LBRY Network was designed to eventually have a circulation of approximately 1 billion LBC. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[id.] at 4 ¶ 13. Most of the LBC will be released in the future to compensate miners, but when the LBRY Blockchain launched in June 2016, LBRY reserved a “pre-mine” of 400 million LBC for itself.

It then sorted its LBC into three buckets: (1) 200 million into a “Community Fund,” to be used for “spreading usage and adoption” of the Network by “rewarding early adopters,” “recruiting producers,” and “rewarding contributors to the community”; (2) 100 million into an “Institutional Fund,” to allow for “the formation of institutional partnerships, as well as for grants and donations to nonprofits and other [NGOs] with similar values as LBRY”; and (3) 100 million into the aptly named “Operational Fund,” to be used for “operational purposes.” [underline]#See# Kauffman Decl., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Doc. No. 61-3] at 5 ¶ 14.  +
	LBRY's co-founders largely self-funded their initial development efforts, but they did raise “a small amount of funds from a number of angel investors.” [underline]#See# Def.'s Mem., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791680[Doc. No. 61-1] at 5. In September 2016, the company also obtained $500,000 in debt financing through Pillar VC, a venture capital firm. [underline]#See# Kauffman Decl., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791682[Doc. No. 61-3] at 9 ¶ 29. Since then, LBRY has largely relied on sales and transfers of LBC to fund its operations.

 . ANALYSIS +
 To establish a prima facie violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act, the SEC must prove that LBRY offered or sold securities in interstate commerce without filing a registration statement. [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iedab2640c58d11ecbf45df569f0c2bfa/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_8173_939++[SEC v.

Kahlon, 873 F.3d 500, 504 (5th Cir. 2017)]. LBRY does not challenge the SEC's contention that it offered and sold LBC in interstate commerce without registering its offerings with the SEC. Nor does it argue that its past offerings fall within an exemption to the registration requirement. Thus, the only issues impeding a finding that LBRY violated Section 5 are LBRY's claim that it did not offer LBC as a security and its argument that it was not given fair notice that it needed to register its offerings. I address each issue in turn.

.. Did LBRY Offer LBC as a Security? +
When Congress adopted the Securities Act, “it enacted a definition of ‘security’ sufficiently broad to encompass virtually any instrument that might be sold as an investment.” link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I5dff0cc59c9011d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_780_60++[Reves v.

The First Circuit has broken the Howey test into three parts: “(1) the investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with an expectation of profits to be derived solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.” link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I13202b1079bf11d9ac1ffa9f33b6c3b0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_48++[SG Ltd., 265 F.3d at 46]. Here, only the third component of the Howey test is in dispute. Thus, the issue to be decided is whether the economic realities surrounding LBRY's offerings of LBC led investors to have “a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.”xref:#sec_v_lbry_footnote_2[*^_(ii)_^*] [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iab8f1e949bf011d991d0cc6b54f12d4d/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_780_852++[Forman, 421 U.S. at 852]. I analyze the evidence that bears on this issue by first examining LBRY's representations to prospective purchasers and the company's business model. I then turn to LBRY's argument that it has not offered LBC as a security because some purchasers acquired LBC for use on the LBRY Network.
[numeric]
... LBRY's Representations to Potential Purchasers +
The SEC identifies multiple statements by LBRY that it claims led potential investors to reasonably expect that LBC would grow in value as the company continued to oversee the development of the LBRY Network. LBRY minimizes the significance of these statements, and points to its many disclaimers that it did not intend for LBC to be purchased as an investment, but the SEC is correct. LBRY has - at key moments and despite its protestations - been acutely aware of LBC's potential value as an investment. And it made sure potential investors were too. +
When LBRY launched the LBRY Network in June 2016, LBC's market capitalization was a healthy $140 million. [underline]#See# 7/15/2016 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[Doc. No. 57-11]. This, despite the Network's relative infancy and limited usability. By the following month, LBC's market capitalization had ballooned to $1.2 billion. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[Id.] In response, LBRY issued a blog post reflecting on LBC's skyrocketing value. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] +
LBRY captioned the post: “1.2B Market Cap and We Don't Care.” Id. It began by touting the rapid growth in LBC's value, but frankly acknowledged that it could not say whether the current valuation was justified. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] At that point, only three videos were available on the blockchain, each produced by LBRY itself. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] And LBRY's staff were hard at work “frantically debugging” and developing its product. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] What LBRY did claim to know though was “that the long-term value proposition of LBRY is tremendous, but also dependent on our team staying focused on the task at hand: building this thing.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] It then closed the post by announcing a policy of neutrality with respect to LBC's price but plainly stating that “[o]ver the long-term, the interests of LBRY and the holders of [LBC] are aligned.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] +
In August 2016, the COO of LBRY, Josh Finer, emailed a potential investor explaining that the company was “currently negotiating private placements of LBC with several [other] investors” and asked the recipient to write him back “if there is interest” so the two could “chat.” [underline]#See# COO Email, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[Doc. No. 59-7].xref:#sec_v_lbry_footnote_3[*^_(iii)_^*] The thrust of the email (subject line: “LBRY Credits Now Trading – LBC”) is clear. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[id.] After briefly noting that the platform was up and running, the COO explained how LBC are being traded on “major crypto exchanges” and that trading volume is moving at a healthy clip. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[id.] The “opportunity is obvious,” wrote the COO, “buy a bunch of credits, put them away safely, and hope that in 1-3 years we've appreciated even 10% of how much Bitcoin has in the past few years.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[id.] He wraps up by pitching LBRY's commitment to building its Network: “[i]f our product has the utility we plan, the credits should appreciate accordingly.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791488[id.] + 
 By November 2016, LBC's price was down, and some LBC investors were getting jittery. Jeremy Kauffman, LBRY's CEO, published a blog post titled “Acryptypical: The CEO of LBRY on the price of LBC,” outlining his view of LBRY's condition and providing “a canonical answer to questions about the price of LBC.” [underline]#See# 11/15/2016 Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[Doc. No. 57-21]. LBC's price was low, he contended, because of simple economics: the supply of LBC entering circulation through mining was outpacing the demand for new tokens. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] And demand was low because, at that point, “there [was] no reason to buy” LBC. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] When LBRY launched, Kauffman explained, it was “the barest, minimum proof-of-concept [application] possible.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] +
 Although it had only been a few months since the launch, LBRY still stressed its long-term goal of “buil[ding] a product that is compelling enough to change people's habits,” replacing “YouTube” and “Amazon.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] And while investors were unlikely to make a “quick buck,” Kauffman encouraged them to “hold onto [their LBC] (or spend it to buy some of [LBRY's] great content . . . .).” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791463[id.] LBRY's message was clear: We are a work in progress. LBC reflects that. Bear with us.  +
 In another communication, this time on Reddit, a user who was “trying to do [their] research before putting in [their] money” asked some general questions about how LBRY would manage its holdings of LBC. [underline]#See# Reddit Thread, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791462[Doc. No. 57-20]. In response, LBRY's Community Manager explained that the only way LBC will be “worth something in the future is if LBRY delivers on their promises to create a revolutionary way to share and monetize content.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791462[id.] The thread also includes another Redditor advising the community manager on what information “would help people with their investment decisions.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791462[id.] + 
 Another relevant representation came in an interview with Mike Vine, LBRY's “Technology Evangelist”. [underline]#See# Vine Interview, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791461[Doc. No. 57-19]. Vine explained how the future “value of LBRY credits” would depend on “the success of our media marketplace.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791461[id.] When the interviewer asked how LBRY would keep “stolen[,] . . . unsavory, or downright illegal” content from the protocol, Vine's response betrayed LBRY's powerbroking role within its ecosystem by explaining that LBRY might be able to use its “position as the ‘market maker’ of [LBC] to basically make it more expensive for people to abuse the network.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791461[id.]  +
In January 2018, Kauffman wrote further on the benefits of blockchain technology in another essay entitled “Blockchain is Love, Blockchain is Life.” 
[underline]#See# 1/10/2018 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[Doc. No. 57-16]. There, he wrote about what he called the “incentive problem[]” in developing open-source alternatives to existing technologies that are controlled by private companies. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[id.] One solution to this problem, as Kauffman saw it, was to be found in blockchain technology, which allowed for blockchain tokens to be used to realign incentives. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[id.] Because a blockchain token “has value in proportion to the usage and success of the network,” developers are incentivized to work to develop and promote new uses for blockchain. link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[Id.] As Kauffman put it: +
`_"It means that the people who discover and utilize a new protocol or network when it's just getting off the ground can reap substantial value by being there first. This solves the incentive problems around being a first-mover and softens the pain of using a service that probably won't be as feature-rich or slick as established competitors' options. It provides a source of funding for the development of the protocol. The creators can use the token to pay for the salaries and equipment required to get it started."_` +
link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791458[Id.] +
And in yet another post, this time in October 2020, LBRY provided another positive update. [underline]#See# 10/14/2020 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[Doc. No. 57-24]. It explained that it still saw itself as meeting the consumer “demand for a userowned and controlled alternative to YouTube and big tech.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[id.] Indeed, its work creating a “compelling token economy centered around digital content exchange” was still “imminently achievable” with just “some tweaks.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[id.] LBRY also touted the enormous potential it saw in continuing to develop its application on its blockchain. Other blockchain companies, the post asserted, are forced to rely on “some third-party” to “magicly [sic] build a world-class application” on their blockchains. [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[id.] Not LBRY. And since “[a]pplications used by billions of people can be worth trillions of dollars,” LBRY was uniquely poised to “deliver that value” by “own[ing] the whole stack.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791466[id.]  +
 	These statements are representative of LBRY's overall messaging about the growth potential for LBC, and thus the SEC is correct that potential investors would understand that LBRY was pitching a speculative value proposition for its digital token. LBRY's messaging amounts to precisely the “not-very-subtle form of economic inducement” the First Circuit identified in [underline]#SG# as evidencing [underline]#Howey's# “expectation of profits.” [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I13202b1079bf11d9ac1ffa9f33b6c3b0/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_54++[SG Ltd., 265 F.3d at 54-55]. +
 	LBRY does not disavow its statements regarding LBC's value or price, but notes that the statements the SEC identifies constitute only 0.25% of “the total number of posts and messages the company has published since its inception.” [underline]#See# Def.'s Obj., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845[Doc. No. 74] at 5. But this statistic relies on a misleading denominator. Of course, like many other companies, LBRY regularly publishes statements on a range of topics, and could not argue that the 8,805 tweets it identified having posted, [underline]#see# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845[id.], all pertain in equal measure to its views of LBC's long-term value proposition. Since LBRY makes no effort to tally the number of comparable statements to those identified by the SEC, its argument lacks weight.  +
LBRY also relies on the fact that it informed some potential purchasers of LBC that the company was not offering its token as an investment. But a disclaimer cannot undo the objective economic realities of a transaction. [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I4ba864e06e4411eaafc9a4147037e074/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_7903_365++[SEC v.

... LBRY's Business Model +
As I just laid out, LBRY made no secret in its communications with potential investors that it expected LBC to grow in value through its managerial and entrepreneurial efforts. But even if it had never explicitly broadcast its views on the subject, any reasonable investor who was familiar with the company's business model would have understood the connection. +
From its inception, LBRY's profitability turned on its ability to grow the value of LBC by increasing usage of the LBRY Network. As Kauffman explained in an October 2016 informal business plan, LBC was the means by which LBRY and other early adopters would be able to profit as use of the network increased. [underline]#See# LBRY Plan, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030[Doc. No. 62-2] at 9. This was because “[e]ach percentage of [LBC] can be thought of as having a value proportional to the sum of all information transacted through the network.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030[Id.] In other words, as demand for information stored on the blockchain increased, so too would LBC's value. Accordingly, Kauffman reasoned, “[g]iven this situation, the most reasonable path to profit is to reserve a portion of the cryptocurrency.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030[Id.] Later in the same plan, he discussed the company's liquidation value by stating “[s]ince LBRY's most significant asset will be its credits, it could simply liquify these credits at a return of 10-10,000x on any investment.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712792030[Id.] at 10. +
 Similarly, in a post on its website titled “Answers to Big Questions From our Reddit AMA,” LBRY responded to the question “How does the company behind LBRY make money?” by stating:  +
`_"The LBRY protocol has a built-in digital currency that allows it to function, called LBRY Credits. These Credits are very similar to bitcoins. Having a built-in digital currency creates an opportunity for a new kind of business that has never existed: the protocolfirst enterprise . . . LBRY Inc. has reserved 10% of all LBRY Credits to fund continued development and provide profit for the founders. Since Credits only gain value as the use of the protocol grows, the company has an incentive to continue developing this open-source project."_` +
9/28/2016 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791450[Doc. No. 57-8]. +
 The problem for LBRY is not just that a reasonable purchaser of LBC would understand that the tokens being offered represented investment opportunities - even if LBRY never said a word about it. It is that, by retaining hundreds of millions of LBC for itself, LBRY also signaled that it was motivated to work tirelessly to improve the value of its blockchain for itself and any LBC purchasers. This structure, which any reasonable purchaser would understand, would lead purchasers of LBC to expect that they too would profit from their holdings of LBC as a result of LBRY's assiduous efforts. + 
 Simply put, by intertwining LBRY's financial fate with the commercial success of LBC, LBRY made it obvious to its investors that it would work diligently to develop the Network so that LBC would increase in value. As LBRY said, “[o]ver the long-term, the interests of LBRY and the holders of Credits are aligned.” [underline]#See# 7/15/2016 LBRY Article, link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[Doc. No. 57-11]. The SEC's burden is made all the easier by statements LBRY made about its managerial efforts, like how “the long-term value proposition of LBRY is . . . dependent on our team staying focused on the task at hand: building this thing.” [underline]#See# link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791453[id.] By its own account, LBRY expended significant managerial efforts to develop its Network and increase the value of LBC.  +
... Consumptive Uses for LBC +
LBRY's primary response to the SEC's claim starts with two generally uncontested facts: (1) LBC is a utility token designed for use on the LBRY Blockchain, and (2) some unknown number of purchasers of LBC acquired it at least in part with the intention of using it rather than holding it as an investment. Building from there, LBRY leaps to the conclusion that LBC cannot be a security even if LBRY offered it as an investment. LBRY is mistaken about both the facts and the law. +
Nothing in the case law suggests that a token with both consumptive and speculative uses cannot be sold as an investment contract. Despite LBRY's insistence to the contrary, I cannot reject the SEC's contention that LBRY offered LBC as a security simply because some LBC purchases were made with consumptive intent. Were it otherwise, the Securities Act would be unable to adapt to the “countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits” wherever a token held some consumptive utility. [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I22292b4f9bf011d993e6d35cc61aab4a/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_780_299++[Howey, 328 U.S.] at 299. 
Accordingly, statements from a subset of LBC holders that they purchased LBC for use on the LBRY Blockchain is of limited relevance in determining whether LBRY offered it as a security. [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I14265fa660e511deb08de1b7506ad85b/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_1021++[Warfield, 569 F.3d] at 1021 (“[W]hile the subjective intent of the purchasers may have some bearing on the issue of whether they entered into investment contracts, we must focus our inquiry on what the purchasers were offered or promised.”). +
In summary, what the evidence in the record discloses is that LBRY promoted LBC as an investment that would grow in value over time through the company's development of the LBRY Network. While some unknown number of purchasers may have acquired LBC in part for consumptive purposes, this does not change the fact that the objective economic realities of LBRY's offerings of LBC establish that it was offering it as a security.xref:#sec_v_lbry_footnote_4[*^_(iv)_^*] + 
.. Did LBRY Receive Fair Notice? +
LBRY argues that I should nonetheless deny the SEC's motion because it did not receive fair notice that its offerings were subject to the securities laws. In pressing this argument, LBRY has abandoned any broad claim that it lacked fair notice of the way in which the [underline]#Howey# test applies to digital tokens in general. Def.'s Obj., link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845[Doc. No. 74] at 24. Instead, it complains that it lacked fair notice because, until the SEC brought this action, “the Commission historically and consistently focused its guidance, as well as its enforcement efforts, exclusively on the issuance of digital assets in the context of an [Initial Coin Offering] ICO.” link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712810845[Id.] +
The principal problem with LBRY's fair notice argument is that it offers nothing more to support its position than its bald claim that this is the first case in which the SEC has attempted to enforce the registration requirement against an issuer of digital tokens that did not conduct an ICO. +
LBRY does not point to any specific statement by the SEC suggesting that companies need only comply with the registration requirement if they conduct an ICO. Nor does LBRY offer any persuasive reading of [underline]#Howey# that would cause a reasonable issuer to conclude that only ICOs are subject to the registration requirement. The test outlined in [underline]#Howey# is necessarily a factspecific one, in which no single fact will likely be dispositive. While participation in an ICO may be relevant to the analysis, it will not determine the outcome in a case like this, where the undisputed evidence leaves no doubt that LBRY offered and sold LBC as a security.  +
LBRY relies on the Second Circuit's decision in [underline]#Upton v. SEC# for the proposition that the SEC may not impose a sanction for violating the securities laws “pursuant to a substantial change in its enforcement policy that was not reasonably communicated to the public.” [underline]#See# link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_98++[75 F.3d 92, 98 (2nd Cir. 1996)]. But, as the SEC notes, the facts of [underline]#Upton# bear no resemblance to the present case. [underline]#Upton# involved an attempt by the SEC to sanction the CFO of a brokerage firm for violating an SEC rule that established a formula for setting the amount of money that the brokerage was required to maintain in a customer reserve account. link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_93++[Id.] at 93. Although it was undisputed that the brokerage had at all times complied with the “literal terms” of the rule, an administrative law judge relied on a novel interpretation of the rule by the SEC to conclude that the CFO could be sanctioned. link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_94++[Id.] at 94-96. Because the SEC did not give public notice of its new interpretation until after the brokerage had ended its offensive practice, the Second Circuit vacated the sanction imposed by the Commission. link:++https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Iae5be07091e711d9bdd1cfdd544ca3a4/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=da3.0&fragmentIdentifier=co_pp_sp_506_94++[Id.] at 98. +
The present case is obviously quite different from the problem the court confronted in [underline]#Upton#. The SEC has not based its enforcement action here on a novel interpretation of a rule that by its terms does not expressly prohibit the relevant conduct. Instead, the SEC has based its claim on a straightforward application of a venerable Supreme Court precedent that has been applied by hundreds of federal courts across the country over more than 70 years. While this may be the first time it has been used against an issuer of digital tokens that did not conduct an ICO, LBRY is in no position to claim that it did not receive fair notice that its conduct was unlawful. 
. CONCLUSION +
As I have explained, the only issues raised by the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment are whether LBRY offered LBC as a security and whether LBRY received fair notice that it needed to register its offerings. Because no reasonable trier of fact could reject the SEC's contention that LBRY offered LBC as a security, and LBRY does not have a triable defense that it lacked fair notice, the SEC is entitled to judgment. The SEC's Motion for Summary J udgment (link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791412[Doc. No. 55]) is granted, and LBRY's Motion for Summary Judgment (link:https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/doc1/11712791679[Doc. No. 61]) is denied. The Clerk shall schedule a status conference to discuss the process for resolving any remaining issues.

*I.*

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against Zachary Coburn (“Coburn” or “Respondent”).

*II.*

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer of Settlement (the “Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

*III.*

On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission findsxref:#coburn_footnote_1[*^_(1)_^*] that:

[underline]#Summary#

. As described more fully below, EtherDelta is an online platform that allows buyers and sellers to trade certain digital assets – Ether and “ERC20 tokens” – in secondary market trading. ERC20 tokens refer to digital assets issued and distributed on the Ethereum Blockchain using the ERC20 protocol, which is the standard coding protocol currently used by a significant majority of issuers in Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”).xref:#coburn_footnote_2[*^_(2)_^*]
. EtherDelta’s website, launched by Coburn on July 12, 2016, provides a user-friendly interface to EtherDelta and resembles online securities trading platforms. For example, the website makes token “pairs”xref:#coburn_footnote_3[*^_(3)_^*] available for trading, provides access to the EtherDelta order book, and displays the current, top 500 firm bids and offers by symbol, price, and size. The website also displays account information for users of the EtherDelta platform (“Users”) (tracked by the User’s Ethereum address and maintained in an internal ledger) and provides fields for Users to input trading interest in any token pair. Users may enter orders to buy or sell specified quantities of any ERC20 token at a specified price (in Ether) and with a specified time-in-force. The website also displays to Users market depthxref:#coburn_footnote_4[*^_(4)_^*] charts and a list of confirmed trades.
. On July 25, 2017, the Commission issued its Report of Investigation Pursuant To Section 21(a) Of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO (Exchange Act Rel. No. 81207) (July 25, 2017) (the “DAO Report”). In the DAO Report, the Commission advised that a platform that offers trading of digital assets that are securities and operates as an “exchange,” as defined by the federal securities laws, must register with the Commission as a national securities exchange or be exempt from registration.
. From July 12, 2016 to December 15, 2017 (the “Relevant Period”), more than 3.6 million buy and sell orders in ERC20 tokens that included securities as defined by Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act were traded on EtherDelta, of which approximately 92% (3.3 million) were traded during the period following the DAO Report.
. As discussed further below, EtherDelta meets the criteria of an “exchange” as defined by Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 3b-16 thereunder. During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta was not registered with the Commission as a national securities exchange and it did not operate pursuant to any exemption from registration. As a result, and as discussed further below, Coburn should have known that his actions would contribute to EtherDelta’s violations and thus, under Exchange Act Section 21C(a), caused EtherDelta to violate Section 5 of the Exchange Act. 

[.text-center] 
[underline]#Respondent# 

[start=6]
. Coburn, age 31, is a resident of Chicago, Illinois. From September 2010 to June 2015, Coburn was a registered representative with a Chicago-based options trading firm that was a broker-dealer registered with the Commission. In approximately June 2015, Coburn left that firm to pursue his own business interests. In March 2016, he created EtherOpt, an online platform for trading options and, in July 2016, he created EtherDelta.xref:#coburn_footnote_5[*^_(5)_^*] In November 2017, Coburn entered into an agreement to sell EtherDelta to foreign buyers and, as of December 16, 2017, Coburn ceased to collect any fees from Users of the platform. Coburn does not currently operate EtherDelta. 

[.text-center] 
[underline]#Facts# +
[underline]#The EtherDelta Website and Hours of Operations# 

[start=7]
. As seen below, the EtherDelta website had features similar to online securities trading platforms. For each Ether/ERC20 token pair available for trading on EtherDelta, the website provided access to the EtherDelta order book and displayed the top 500 orders to buy and orders to sell, sorted by price and color (buy orders are green and sell orders are red). The website provided User account information and provided fields for Users to input deposit, withdrawal, and trading interest. The website also provided Users’ daily transaction volumes per token, market depth charts, and a list of User’s confirmed trades.
. During the Relevant Period, the EtherDelta platform was available to anyone, including U.S. persons, and had no specified hours of operation. As long as EtherDelta’s website was operational, Users could interact directly with the EtherDelta smart contract or enter orders and trade tokens through the website 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

[align="center"]
image::media/ch03-img01.jpg[]


[.text-center] 
[underline]#The EtherDelta Smart Contract# 

[start=9]
. EtherDelta’s business operations are defined and executed by EtherDelta’s “smart contract”xref:#coburn_footnote_6[*^_(6)_^*] that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain. The EtherDelta smart contract consists of coded functionsxref:#coburn_footnote_7[*^_(7)_^*] that allow for, among other things, the trading of any Ether/ ERC20 token pair.xref:#coburn_footnote_8[*^_(8)_^*] On July 8, 2016, Coburn deployed the code for the first EtherDelta smart contract, written in the programming language Solidity, onto the Ethereum Blockchain. When it was deployed, the EtherDelta smart contract created an Ethereum Blockchain address, where the smart contract “resides.”xref:#coburn_footnote_9[*^_(9)_^*]
. Because the EtherDelta smart contract runs on the Ethereum Blockchain, every interaction with EtherDelta by a User requires the User to send a message to the Ethereum Blockchain mining network to be executed on the EtherDelta smart contract.xref:#coburn_footnote_10[*^_(10)_^*] When Ethereum Blockchain miners run the EtherDelta smart contract, the smart contract applies a preexisting set of rules (i.e., its code) to given inputs. If the User’s message results in a change of state to the Ethereum Blockchain, such as through a User request to move or withdraw ERC20 tokens to and from the EtherDelta smart contract, or through a User request to trade on the EtherDelta platform, among other things, the Ethereum Blockchain miners then record that change of state, i.e., reflecting the transfer of Ether and/or ERC20 tokens to and from addresses, to the Ethereum Blockchain. If the User’s message does not result in a change of state, such as through a User request to check the balance of the User’s Ethereum address on EtherDelta, there is no change of state recorded to the Ethereum Blockchain.

[.text-center] 
[underline]#EtherDelta User Eligibility# 

[start=11]
. As a prerequisite for submitting an order to the platform, a User must first have an Ethereum wallet address that is capable of sending messages to the Ethereum Blockchain. Users may create a new wallet address through EtherDelta’s website or by using other wallet software that is compatible with EtherDelta. Users trade on EtherDelta pseudonymously by using one or more Ethereum addresses, each a unique string of numbers and letters. Users must also demonstrate that they have available ERC20 tokens or Ether to trade on EtherDelta. 

[.text-center] 
[underline]#Tokens Eligible for Trading and EtherDelta’s “Official Listings”# 

[start=12]
. Users may enter orders to buy or sell any token that is ERC20 compliant. Coburn purposely wrote the EtherDelta smart contract to include the ERC20 token coding standard and there are no rules set forth in the smart contract that limit a User from trading any particular ERC20 token on EtherDelta.
. During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta maintained a list of “official [token] listings, a select list of ERC20 Tokens that were available for trading on EtherDelta.” Prior to identifying a token as an official listing, Coburn requested certain information from a token issuer (e.g., the token’s name, associated website URL, and a paragraph describing the token) and performed his own due diligence on these tokens. Official listings appeared on a drop down menu on a sidebar on EtherDelta’s website for easy User accessibility. During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta had approximately 500 official token listings.

[.text-center] 
[underline]#The EtherDelta Order Book# 

[start=14]
. With respect to a given order, an EtherDelta User is identified as either a “maker” or “taker” on the EtherDelta platform. A maker is someone that posts an order to buy or sell a particular ERC20 token on the EtherDelta website, which signals to other Users their intention to trade a particular token at a specific price, size, and time. A taker is someone seeking to become the counterparty to a maker’s order on the platform.

Order Types and Order Entry

[start=15]
. The only order type available on EtherDelta is a limit order to buy or sell a token at a specific price. There are no market orders.xref:#coburn_footnote_11[*^_(11)_^*]  Users indicate their interest to buy or sell a token by entering a buy or sell order. At the time an order is entered, Users provide the following information onto the EtherDelta’s website: token symbol, size, price and time-in-force (measured in “blocks”).xref:#coburn_footnote_12[*^_(12)_^*] 
. Unlike other operations on EtherDelta, entering an order on EtherDelta does not change the state of the Ethereum Blockchain and, as a result, there is no gas fee (paid in Ether to the Ethereum miners) associated with entering an order on EtherDelta. Rather, all orders are stored in EtherDelta’s order book, which resides on a centralized server maintained by EtherDelta and not on the Ethereum Blockchain.xref:#coburn_footnote_13[*^_(13)_^*]  As discussed above, for each token pair, EtherDelta’s website displays only the top 500 buy and sell orders, sorted by price and order type (buy or sell). 

Order Execution and the Order Book

[start=17]
. All orders on EtherDelta must be acted upon by a taker for a trade to occur. When a taker seeks to trade with a maker’s order, the taker, through the EtherDelta website interface, clicks on an order displayed on EtherDelta’s order book and enters the size of the order. This pairs the maker’s cryptographically-signed intent to trade (i.e., the maker order) with the taker’s cryptographically-signed intent to trade (i.e., the taker’s order) and instructs the Ethereum Blockchain miners to run the EtherDelta smart contract, which automatically performs certain checks.
. No further confirmation or action is required by the taker for the taker’s message to be executed by the smart contract and for a trade to occur. The smart contract checks that the messages are valid (contain valid cryptographic signatures), confirms the conditions of the orders (i.e., orders have not expired or been canceled) and that both Users have sufficient funds and/or tokens to complete the trade. If the messages are valid and there are sufficient funds and/or tokens, the trade is executed and the smart contract will update the smart contract’s internal ledger to reflect the trade. The maker order will remain displayed on EtherDelta’s website until the miners write the trade and post it to the Ethereum Blockchain. Thereafter, information displayed on the EtherDelta order book and website is updated.
. When a taker clicks on a maker’s order, this action will automatically result in a trade unless: (1) there are insufficient funds and/or tokens to complete the trade or pay the gas fee; (2) a competing taker’s order is confirmed on the Blockchain first; (3) the maker’s order has expired; or (4) the maker or taker’s order has been cancelled.xref:#coburn_footnote_14[*^_(14)_^*]

[.text-center]
[underline]#Notices to Users#

[start=20]
. During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta Users were kept apprised of key events and other announcements regarding the platform’s operations through an official EtherDelta Twitter handle and Coburn’s posts on Reddit.xref:#coburn_footnote_15[*^_(15)_^*] Coburn also responded to User questions through an official “Gitter channel,” a public internet forum for Users and EtherDelta representatives to post written questions and answers about EtherDelta’s operations.
. In posts on Reddit, Coburn explained that: “[a]t a high level, EtherDelta functions just like a normal exchange” and “[l]ike any other exchange, EtherDelta has an order book of resting orders.”xref:#coburn_footnote_16[*^_(16)_^*] However, unlike a traditional exchange, “[t]here is no ‘exchange owner’ holding your funds. Hence, [EtherDelta is] decentralized.... Centralized exchanges won't be able to show you verified business logic [in a publicly verified smart contract].”

[.text-center]
[underline]#Platform Fees#

[start=22]
. To promote trade volume, EtherDelta did not charge a fee to a maker for placing an order. Takers, on the other hand, were charged 0.3% of a transaction’s trade volume.xref:#coburn_footnote_17[*^_(17)_^*]

[.text-center]
[underline]#Legal Analysis#

*A. EtherDelta Violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act*
[start=23] 
. Section 5 of the Exchange Act makes it unlawful for any broker, dealer, or exchange, directly or indirectly, to effect any transaction in a security, or to report any such transaction, in interstate commerce, unless the exchange is registered as a national securities exchange under Section 6 of the Exchange Act, or is exempted from such registration. Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act defines an “exchange” as “any organization, association, or group of persons, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which constitutes, maintains, or provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood, and includes the market place and the market facilities maintained by such exchange.” 15 USC § 78c(a)(1).
. Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) provides a functional test to assess whether a trading system meets the definition of exchange under Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) provides that an organization, association, or group of persons shall be considered to constitute, maintain, or provide “a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by an exchange” as those terms are used in Section 3(a)(1) of the Exchange Act if such an organization, association, or group of persons: (1) brings together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers; and (2) uses established, non-discretionary methods (whether by providing a trading facility or by setting rules) under which such orders interact with each other, and the buyers and sellers entering such orders agree to the terms of the trade.xref:#coburn_footnote_18[*^_(18)_^*]
. A system that meets the criteria of Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a), and is not excluded under Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(b), must register, pursuant to Section 5 of the Exchange Act, as a national securities exchange under Section 6 of the Exchange Actxref:#coburn_footnote_19[*^_(19)_^*] or operate pursuant to an appropriate exemption. One of the available exemptions is for alternative trading systems (“ATSs”).xref:#coburn_footnote_20[*^_(20)_^*] Exchange Act Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) exempts from the definition of “exchange” under Section 3(a)(1) an organization, association, or group of persons that complies with Regulation ATS.xref:#coburn_footnote_21[*^_(21)_^*] Regulation ATS requires an ATS to, among other things, register as a broker-dealer, file a Form ATS with the Commission to notice its operations, and establish written safeguards and procedures to protect subscribers’ confidential trading information. An ATS that complies with Regulation ATS and operates pursuant to the Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) exemption would not be required by Section 5 to register as a national securities exchange.
. EtherDelta satisfied the criteria of Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) and is not excluded under Rule 3b-16(b). During the Relevant Period, EtherDelta operated as a market place for bringing together the orders of multiple buyers and sellers in tokens that included securities as defined by Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act. The purchasers of such digital tokens invested money with a reasonable expectation of profits, including through the increased value of their investments in secondary trading, based on the managerial efforts of others. See DAO Report; SEC v. Edwards, 540 U.S. 389, 393 (2004); SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 301 (1946). As discussed above, EtherDelta brought together orders by receiving and storing orders in tokens in the EtherDelta order book and displaying the top 500 orders (including token symbol, size, and price) as bids and offers on the EtherDelta website. EtherDelta provided the means for these orders to interact and execute through the combined use of the EtherDelta website, order book, and pre-programmed trading protocols defined in the EtherDelta smart contract. These established non-discretionary methods allowed Users to agree upon the terms of their trades in tokens on EtherDelta during the Relevant Period.
. Despite operating as a Rule 3b-16(a) system, EtherDelta did not register as a national securities exchange or operate pursuant to an exemption from such registration. Accordingly, EtherDelta violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act. 

*B. Coburn Caused EtherDelta to Violate Section 5 of the Exchange Act*
[start=28] 
. During the relevant period, Coburn founded EtherDelta, wrote and deployed the EtherDelta smart contract to the Ethereum Blockchain, and exercised complete and sole control over EtherDelta’s operations, including over the operations constituting the violations described above. Coburn should have known that his actions would contribute to EtherDelta’s violations and thus, under Exchange Act Section 21C(a), caused EtherDelta to violate Section 5 of the Exchange Act.

[.text-center]
[underline]#Respondent’s Remedial Efforts#

[start=29]
. In determining to accept the Offer, including the decision not to impose a greater penalty, the Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Respondent and cooperation afforded the Commission staff. Coburn’s efforts facilitated the staff’s investigation involving an emerging technology. 

*IV.*

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent’s Offer.

Accordingly, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, it is hereby ordered that:

[upperalpha]
. Respondent Coburn cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.
. Respondent Coburn shall pay disgorgement of $300,000 and prejudgment interest of $13,000, for a total of $313,000, to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the United States Treasury subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600.
. Respondent Coburn shall, within 10 days of this Order, pay a civil money penalty of $75,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the United States Treasury subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. §3717.
. Payments under this Order must be made in one of the following ways:
[arabic]
.. Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;
.. Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or
.. Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to: +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enterprise Services Center +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts Receivable Branch +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341 +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6500 South MacArthur Boulevard +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oklahoma City, OK 73169 +
Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying Zachary Coburn as Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Robert A. Cohen, Chief, Cyber Unit, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549, or such other person or address as the Commission staff may provide.

. Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor Action, he shall not argue that he is entitled to, nor shall he benefit by, offset or reduction of any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset"). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that he shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor Action" means a private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this proceeding.
. Respondent acknowledges that the Commission is not imposing a civil penalty in excess of $75,000 based upon his cooperation in a Commission investigation and his agreement to testify in any related enforcement action. If at any time following the entry of the Order, the Division of Enforcement (“Division”) obtains information indicating that Respondent knowingly provided materially false or misleading information or materials to the Commission or in a related proceeding, the Division may, at its sole discretion and with prior notice to the Respondent, petition the Commission to reopen this matter and seek an order directing that the Respondent pay an additional civil penalty. Respondent may contest by way of defense in any resulting administrative proceeding whether he knowingly provided materially false or misleading information, but may not: (1) contest the findings in the Order; or (2) assert any defense to liability or remedy, including, but not limited to, any statute of limitations defense.

*V.*

It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by Coburn, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other amounts due by Coburn under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by Coburn of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).

`2`. An ICO is a term that describes the offer and sale of digital assets issued and distributed on a blockchain. A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, or peer-to-peer database spread across a network, that records all transactions in the network in theoretically unchangeable, digitally-recorded data packages called blocks. Each block contains a batch of records of transactions, including a timestamp and a reference to the previous block, linking the blocks together in a chain. The system relies on cryptographic techniques for secure recording of transactions. A blockchain can be shared and accessed by anyone with appropriate permissions. The Ethereum Blockchain is an open, or permissionless, blockchain that is a record of events resulting from the execution of code (smart contracts) on the Ethereum Blockchain. ERC20 refers to a specific Ethereum token issuing protocol, formally adopted by the Ethereum network in September 2017, and used on the Ethereum Blockchain. (ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comments and 20 is the unique identification used to distinguish this coding standard from other standards.) The ERC20 token standard, created in November 2015, “allows any token on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges” and “provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.” See Fabian Vogelsteller and Vitalik Buterin, ERC-20 Token Standard, November 19, 2015, https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md. The widespread adoption of the ERC20 token standard has also led developers to design applications, such as EtherDelta, that are compatible with any ERC20 token.

`6`. A “smart contract” has been defined as: +
a computerized transaction protocol that executes terms of a contract. The general objectives of smart contract design are to satisfy common contractual conditions (such as payment terms, liens, confidentiality, and even enforcement), minimize exceptions both malicious and accidental, and minimize the need for trusted intermediaries. Related economic goals include lowering fraud loss, arbitrations and enforcement costs, and other transaction costs. +

Alternatively, during the Relevant Period, Users could interact with the EtherDelta smart contract through a user-friendly interface created by Coburn, called The EtherDelta Graphic User Interface (“EtherDelta GUI” or “website”) (accessible at the URL www.etherdelta.com). EtherDelta’s website, allowed Users to interact with the EtherDelta smart contract without having to be a node on the Ethereum Blockchain and without having to understand the details of blockchain technology.

|[[coburn_footnote_9]]
`9`. Only the person with access to the private key for the “administrator account” identified in the EtherDelta smart contract can alter the EtherDelta smart contract; this access was limited to changing the permissible fees or the address of the fee account. At all times during the Relevant Period, Coburn was the only person with access to that private key and therefore, was the only person that had the ability to alter the EtherDelta smart contract.

|[[coburn_footnote_10]]
`10`. Anyone can interact with the Ethereum Blockchain by transmitting a cryptographically-secured message to the Blockchain. That message can be “state-changing” in that it can request that a particular smart contract on the Ethereum Blockchain perform a certain function that results in a change of state of the Blockchain. A state-changing message is also referred to as a “Send.” Alternatively, a message can simply request information already written to the Blockchain, and not result in a change to the state of the Blockchain. That type of message is referred to as a “Call.” Any Send must first be validated and the resulting change of state recorded to the Blockchain by the “mining” activities of a network of Ethereum “miners,” which are computing nodes on the Blockchain. A Send generally requires the payment of “gas,” or a fee paid in Ether to the Ethereum miners. Generally (but not always), the speed at which a transaction is mined on the Ethereum Blockchain is determined by the amount of gas paid by the sender of a transaction to the mining network; the higher the gas price paid for the transaction, the faster a transaction is likely to be mined. The gas price is set by the sender at the time the message is sent to the network.

[underline]#**COMPLAINT**#

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), for its complaint
against Caroline Ellison (“Ellison”) and Zixiao “Gary” Wang (“Wang,” together with Ellison,
“Defendants”), alleges as follows:

[.text-center]
[underline]#**SUMMARY**#
[start=1]
. From at least May 2019 through November 2022, Defendants, together with Samuel Bankman-Fried (“Bankman-Fried”) and others, engaged in a scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX Trading Ltd. (“FTX”), the crypto asset trading platform of which Bankman-Fried and Wang were co-founders, at the same time that they were also defrauding the platform’s customers.xref:#ellison_wang_footnote_1[*^_(1)_^*] FTX raised more than $1.8 billion from investors, including U.S. investors, who bought an equity stake in FTX believing that FTX had appropriate controls and risk management measures. Unbeknownst to those investors (and to FTX’s trading customers), Bankman-Fried was orchestrating a massive, years-long fraud, diverting billions of dollars of the trading platform’s customer funds for his own personal benefit and to help grow his crypto empire. Defendants were active participants in the scheme and engaged in conduct that was critical to its success.
. Throughout this period, Bankman-Fried portrayed himself as a responsible leader of the crypto community. He touted the importance of regulation and accountability. He told the public, including investors, that FTX was both innovative and responsible. Customers around the world believed his lies, and sent billions of dollars to FTX, believing their assets were secure on the FTX trading platform. But Bankman-Fried and Wang improperly diverted customer assets to Alameda Research LLC and its subsidiaries (“Alameda”), the crypto asset hedge fund that they had founded and co-owned and that Ellison ran. Wang created and participated in the creation of the software code that allowed Alameda to divert FTX customer funds. Ellison, in turn, used the misappropriated FTX customer funds for Alameda’s trading activity. And Bankman-Fried used those customer funds to make undisclosed venture investments, lavish real estate purchases, and large political donations.
. Working with Bankman-Fried, Defendants hid the scheme from FTX’s equity investors, including U.S. investors, from whom FTX sought to raise billions of dollars in additional funds. Bankman-Fried repeatedly cast FTX as an innovative and conservative trailblazer in the crypto markets. He told investors and prospective investors that FTX had topnotch, sophisticated automated risk measures in place to protect customer assets, that those assets were safe and secure, and that Alameda was just another platform customer with no special privileges. Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that these statements were false and misleading. In truth, Bankman-Fried and Wang, with Ellison’s knowledge and consent, had exempted Alameda from the risk mitigation measures and had provided Alameda with significant special treatment on the FTX platform, including a virtually unlimited “line of credit” funded by the platform’s customers. 
. Beyond its “line of credit” with FTX, Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, caused Alameda to borrow billions of dollars from third party lenders. Those loans were backed in significant part by Alameda’s holdings of FTT—an illiquid crypto asset security that was issued by FTX and provided to Alameda at no cost. Ellison, acting at the direction of Bankman-Fried, engaged in automated purchases of FTT tokens on various platforms in order to increase the price of those tokens and inflate the value of Alameda’s collateral, which allowed Alameda to borrow even more money from external lenders at increased risk to the lenders and to FTX’s investors and customers, all in furtherance of the scheme.
. While Bankman-Fried spent lavishly on office space and condominiums in The Bahamas, and sank billions of dollars of customer funds into speculative venture investments, his house of cards began to crumble. When prices of crypto assets plummeted in May 2022, Alameda’s lenders demanded repayment on billions of dollars of loans. Despite the fact that
Alameda had, by this point, already taken billions of dollars of FTX customer assets, it was unable to satisfy its loan obligations. Bankman-Fried, with Defendants’ knowledge, directed FTX to divert billions more in customer assets to Alameda to ensure that Alameda maintained its lending relationships, and that money could continue to flow in from lenders and other investors. Ellison then used FTX’s customer assets to pay Alameda’s debts.
. Even as it was increasingly clear that Alameda and FTX could not make customers whole, Bankman-Fried and Defendants continued to misappropriate FTX customer funds. Through the summer of 2022, Bankman-Fried, with Defendants’ knowledge, directed hundreds of millions more in FTX customer funds to Alameda, which he then used for additional venture investments and for “loans” to himself and other FTX executives, including Wang. All the while, Bankman-Fried continued to make misleading statements to investors about FTX’s financial condition and risk management. Defendants were aware that Bankman-Fried was making these statements, and knew or were reckless in not knowing that they were false and misleading. Even in November 2022, faced with billions of dollars in customer withdrawal demands that FTX could not fulfill, Bankman-Fried and Ellison, with Wang’s knowledge, misled investors from whom they needed money to plug a multi-billion-dollar hole. This brazen, multiyear scheme finally came to an end when FTX, Alameda, and their tangled web of affiliated entities filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022.

At inception, Alameda was focused on arbitrage trading strategies, but went on to employ other strategies including market making, yield farming (pooling of crypto assets in exchange for interest or other rewards), and volatility trading. Alameda also offered over-thecounter trading services, and made and managed other debt and equity investments. 
. At first, Bankman-Fried was responsible for trading operations, and Wang handled the engineering and programming functions. Over time, Alameda hired additional employees, including Singh (in or around December 2017), Ellison (in or around March 2018), and Trabucco (in or around 2019). By the end of 2021, Alameda had approximately 30 employees. At times, Alameda shared office space and employees with FTX. 
. Bankman-Fried remained the ultimate decision-maker at Alameda, even after Ellison and Trabucco became co-CEOs in or around October 2021. Bankman-Fried directed investment and operational decisions, frequently communicated with Alameda employees, and had full access to Alameda’s records and databases.
. Ellison was a trader at Alameda during the time Bankman-Fried acted as CEO. When Ellison became co-CEO in 2021, and continuing through November 2022, Ellison was responsible for Alameda’s day-to-day operations. Though Ellison made some trading decisions, she frequently consulted with Bankman-Fried, particularly about strategic issues and significant trades.
. In or around 2018, Bankman-Fried began work on building a crypto asset trading platform. Together with Wang and Singh, Bankman-Fried ultimately founded FTX, which began operations in or around May 2019.
. FTX offered its customers a number of services. For example:
[loweralpha]
.. FTX offered a “spot market,” a trading platform through which customers could trade crypto assets with other FTX customers in exchange for fiat currency (i.e., currency such as U.S. Dollars) or other crypto assets.
.. FTX offered “spot margin trading” services, which allowed FTX customers to trade using assets they did not have (i.e., to trade “on margin”) by posting collateral in their FTX accounts and borrowing crypto assets through the “spot market” on the FTX platform. FTX also allowed customers to lend their crypto assets to other FTX customers who would then use those crypto assets to spot trade.
.. FTX offered an off-platform (over-the-counter or “OTC”) portal that enabled customers to connect and request quotes for spot crypto assets and to conduct trades.
. Bankman-Fried was the ultimate decision-maker at FTX from the platform’s inception in or around May 2019 until he resigned as CEO on or about November 11, 2022 (“the Relevant Period”). Wang and Singh were the lead engineers responsible for writing the software code for FTX, including the code that allowed for the services described above.
. In or around January 2020, Bankman-Fried, Wang, and Singh founded FTX US, a crypto asset trading platform designed primarily for customers in the United States.xref:#ellison_wang_footnote_4[*^_(4)_^*]
. Over time, Bankman-Fried expanded his holdings to include a number of companies focused on making and managing private (or “venture”) investments.
. This interconnected web of companies grew to include over 100 separate entities, with Bankman-Fried at the top and Alameda, his crypto hedge fund, at the center. 
. Throughout the Relevant Period, in multiple public statements, Bankman-Fried held himself out as a visionary leader in the crypto industry, and touted his efforts to create a regulated and thriving crypto asset market. He conducted an intensive public relations campaign to brand himself and his companies as honest stewards of crypto.
. The reality was very different: From the start, contrary to what FTX investors and trading customers were told, Bankman-Fried, actively supported by Defendants, continually diverted FTX customer funds to Alameda and then used those funds to continue to grow his empire, using billions of dollars to make undisclosed private venture investments, political contributions, and real estate purchases.
. At the same time, throughout the Relevant Period, Bankman-Fried, with Defendants’ knowledge, solicited equity investors by touting FTX’s controls and risk management, ultimately raising at least $1.8 billion from investors in exchange for various classes of stock in FTX through multiple fundraising rounds, including raising: (1) approximately $8 million from the sale of shares of FTX Series A preferred stock, with fundraising completed in or around August 2019; (2) approximately $1 billion from the sale of shares of FTX Series B preferred stock, with fundraising completed in or around July 2021; (3) approximately $420 million from the sale of shares of FTX Series B-1 stock, with fundraising completed in or around October 2021; and (4) approximately $500 million from the sale of shares of FTX Series C stock, with fundraising completed in or around January 2022. Of this total, approximately $1.1 billion was invested in FTX by approximately 90 investors based in the United States.
. For the entire span of the Relevant Period, while raising money from equity investors, Bankman-Fried, and those speaking at his direction and on his behalf, with the knowledge of Defendants, claimed in widely distributed public forums and directly to investors that: FTX was a safe crypto asset trading platform; FTX had a comparative advantage due to its automated risk mitigation procedures; and FTX and its customers were protected from other customers’ losses due to FTX’s automated liquidation process. As discussed further herein, these statements and others were misleading in light of Bankman-Fried’s failure to disclose to FTX investors the diversion of FTX customer funds to Alameda, which he then used for his own purposes, including loans to himself. Similarly, Bankman-Fried’s statements concerning the separation of FTX and Alameda, made throughout the Relevant Period, were misleading because he did not disclose the special treatment afforded to Alameda on FTX, including its virtually unlimited “line of credit” at FTX, its ability to carry a negative balance in its FTX customer account, and its exemption from FTX’s automated liquidation process—none of which any other customer of the platform enjoyed, but which changed the risk profile of FTX. Defendants were aware that Bankman-Fried was making false or misleading statements in order to raise money for FTX from equity investors. At times, they were in close proximity to these discussions, and directly or indirectly supported Bankman-Fried in providing false and misleading information to investors.
. Bankman-Fried also misrepresented the risk profile of investing in FTX throughout the Relevant Period by failing to disclose FTX’s exposure to Alameda and, relatedly, that the collateral Alameda deposited on FTX consisted largely of illiquid, FTX-affiliated tokens, including FTT, the price of which Alameda was actively manipulating. In addition to these material omissions, Bankman-Fried also made material misrepresentations to FTX investors about FTX’s risk management and its relationship with Alameda. As detailed below, Bankman-Fried made these material misstatements throughout the Relevant Period, and the entire time he was raising or attempting to raise funds for FTX—from the time FTX began operations in May 2019 through its ultimate demise in November 2022. Again, Defendants were aware that Bankman-Fried was making these false or misleading statements and that he was doing so in order to raise money from equity investors, and they directly or indirectly supported him in doing so.

[upperalpha, start=2]
. [underline]#**Defendants Used Alameda to Carry Out the Fraudulent Scheme.**#

[start=34]
. Alameda (and its many subsidiaries) served a number of essential functions in Bankman-Fried’s growing web of companies. For example, Alameda was the primary market maker on FTX at the time of FTX’s inception in 2019. In this capacity, Alameda, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, was tasked with creating liquidity on FTX to allow the platform to function more efficiently. Bankman-Fried also made venture investments through an Alameda subsidiary. Most crucially, Bankman-Fried used Alameda to house FTX customer assets and to deploy those assets, under Bankman-Fried’s direction, to help grow his empire.
. From the inception of FTX, Defendants and Bankman-Fried diverted FTX customer funds to Alameda, and continued to do so until FTX’s collapse in November 2022.
. Defendants and Bankman-Fried diverted FTX customer funds to Alameda in essentially two ways: (1) by directing FTX customers to deposit fiat currency (e.g., U.S. Dollars) into bank accounts controlled by Alameda; and (2) by enabling Alameda to draw down from a virtually limitless “line of credit” at FTX, which was funded by FTX customer assets.
. As a result, there was no meaningful distinction between FTX customer funds and Alameda’s own funds. Bankman-Fried and Wang thus gave Alameda and Ellison carte blanche to use FTX customer assets for Alameda’s trading operations and for whatever other purposes Bankman-Fried and Ellison saw fit. In essence, Bankman-Fried and Wang placed billions of dollars of FTX customer funds into Alameda. Bankman-Fried then used Alameda as his personal piggy bank to buy luxury condominiums, support political campaigns, and make private investments, among other uses. Ellison used these funds for Alameda’s operations, including speculative trading strategies and servicing Alameda’s debt to third-party lenders. Defendants knew that none of this was disclosed to FTX equity investors or to the platform’s trading customers.

[lowerroman, start=1]
. **FTX Customers Deposited Billions of Dollars into Alameda-Owned Bank Accounts, Which Alameda Spent on Its Own Trading Operations and to Expand Bankman-Fried’s Empire.**

[start=38]
. From the start of FTX’s operations in or around May 2019 until at least 2021, FTX customers deposited fiat currency (e.g., U.S. Dollars) into bank accounts controlled by Alameda. Billions of dollars of FTX customer funds were so deposited into Alameda-controlled bank accounts. Ellison was aware that Alameda was receiving FTX customer funds.
. At least some of these bank accounts were not in Alameda’s name, but rather in the name of North Dimension Inc. (“North Dimension”), an Alameda subsidiary. North Dimension’s website does not disclose any connection to Alameda. Ellison knew that Bankman- Fried had directed FTX to have customers send funds to North Dimension in an effort to hide the fact that the funds were being sent to an account controlled by Alameda.
. Alameda did not segregate these customer funds, but instead commingled them with its other assets, and used them indiscriminately to fund its trading operations and Bankman-Fried’s other ventures.
. This multi-billion-dollar liability was reflected in an internal account in the FTX database that was not tied to Alameda but was instead called “fiat@ftx.com.” Characterizing the amount of customer funds sent to Alameda as an internal FTX account had the effect of concealing Alameda’s liability in FTX’s internal systems. Defendants knew that FTX customer funds were being sent to Alameda-controlled bank accounts and that Alameda’s liability was reflected in the “fiat@ftx.com” account.
. In quarterly balance sheets that Ellison prepared, and that were provided to Alameda’s third-party lenders, Alameda tracked this liability as a “loan,” but did not specify that the “loan” was from FTX. Instead, Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, combined this liability with loans Alameda had received from third-party lenders to obscure Alameda’s intertwined financial relationship with FTX.
. Alameda was not required to pay interest on the liability reflected in the “fiat@ftx.com” account.
. In 2022, FTX began trying to separate Alameda’s portion of the liability in the “fiat@ftx.com” account from the portion that was attributable to FTX (i.e., to separate out customer deposits sent to Alameda-controlled bank accounts from deposits sent to FTXcontrolled bank accounts). Alameda’s portion—which amounted to more than $8 billion in FTX customer assets that had been deposited into Alameda-controlled bank accounts—was initially moved to a different account in the FTX database. However, because this change caused FTX’s internal systems to automatically charge Alameda interest on the more than $8 billion liability, Bankman-Fried directed that the Alameda liability be moved to an account that would not be charged interest. This account was associated with an individual that had no apparent connection to Alameda. As a result, this change had the effect of further concealing Alameda’s liability in FTX’s internal systems.

[lowerroman, start=2]
. **The FTX Platform, By Design, Granted Special Treatment to Alameda, Including Features that Allowed Alameda to Divert FTX Customer Assets.**

[start=45]
. In addition to receiving cash deposits directly from FTX customers, Alameda benefited from undisclosed features of the FTX platform, which were embedded in software code developed by Wang and other FTX engineers, and which allowed Alameda to divert FTX customer assets. For example:
[loweralpha]
.. Negative Balance: Alameda was able to maintain a negative balance in its customer account at FTX. Bankman-Fried directed FTX engineers, including Wang, to write software code in or around August 2019, and to update it in or around May 2020, ultimately allowing Alameda to maintain a negative balance in its account, untethered from any collateral requirements. No other customer account at FTX was permitted to maintain a negative balance.
.. Line of Credit: On multiple occasions, Bankman-Fried directed FTX engineers, including Wang, to increase the amount by which Alameda could maintain a negative balance in its account. In effect, this gave an unofficial “line of credit” to Alameda, since Alameda was able to draw down on its FTX customer account and use those funds—which were actually the funds deposited by other FTX customers—for its own trading. At Bankman-Fried’s direction, Wang and others  continually raised the limit on Alameda’s “line of credit” to the point where it grew to tens of billions of dollars and effectively became limitless. No other FTX customer had a similar “line of credit.”
.. Liquidation Exemption: In or around May 2020, Bankman-Fried directed FTX engineers, including Wang, to exempt Alameda from the “auto-liquidation” feature of FTX’s spot margin trading services. As a result, Alameda’s collateral
could fall below the requisite margin levels without triggering the automatic liquidation of its account. Alameda was the only customer exempted from FTX’s automatic account liquidation.
. Defendants were both aware that these special privileges were afforded to Alameda—and only Alameda. Defendants were also both aware that the existence of these special privileges, which were put in place at Bankman-Fried’s direction, were hidden from FTX’s investors. These privileges permitted Alameda to draw on FTX customer assets to a virtually unlimited extent for its own uses. Because its own FTX trading account was able to maintain a negative balance of billions of dollars, unbacked by sufficient collateral—as a direct result of software code implemented by Wang and others—Alameda was able to divert billions of dollars in FTX customer assets. Alameda and Ellison did just that in 2022.

[lowerroman, start=3]
. **In 2022, Alameda Diverted Billions More in FTX Customer Assets.**

[start=47]
. Starting in or around 2021, Bankman-Fried directed Ellison to have Alameda borrow billions of dollars from third-party crypto asset lending firms in order to fund Bankman-Fried’s venture investments and for his personal use. Certain of these loans included provisions permitting the lenders to demand re-payment at any time.
. In or around May 2022, as prices of crypto assets were dropping precipitously, several of these lenders demanded re-payment from Alameda. Because Alameda did not have sufficient assets to cover all of these obligations, Bankman-Fried directed Ellison to draw on Alameda’s “line of credit” from FTX, which, based on the software code that Wang had previously created, allowed Alameda to borrow virtually limitless funds from FTX. Billions of dollars of FTX customer funds were thus diverted to Alameda and used by Alameda to re-pay its third-party loan obligations.
. Because Alameda now had billions of dollars more in liability to FTX (on top of the billions of dollars reflected in the “fiat@ftx.com” account), Bankman-Fried—concerned that this enormous liability would alarm Alameda’s lenders—directed Ellison to hide this “line of credit” in Alameda’s balance sheet. Ellison did so and presented this information to lenders, knowing that it was materially misleading. 
. Despite the fact that Alameda now owed FTX billions of dollars with no immediate prospects of raising capital to pay off its “line of credit,” Bankman-Fried continued to direct Ellison to draw on the Alameda “line of credit” in the summer of 2022. The customer funds diverted to Alameda were used, among other things, to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in “loans” to Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives, as well as hundreds of millions more to fund additional venture investments.

[lowerroman, start=4]
. **Bankman-Fried, with Defendants’ Knowledge and Consent, Assured Investors that FTX Customer Assets Were Secure, and Hid Alameda’s Close Relationship with FTX.**

[start=51]
. Throughout the Relevant Period, Bankman-Fried was directly involved in soliciting potential investors in FTX. Bankman-Fried met, and otherwise communicated, with FTX investors, including investors based in the United States. Along with another FTX employee, Bankman-Fried was the point-person for investor relations at FTX. Defendants knew that Bankman-Fried was meeting with and soliciting funds from equity investors.
. FTX’s Terms of Service, which were publicly available on FTX’s website and accessible to investors, assured FTX customers that their assets were secure, providing: “you control the Digital Assets held in your Account;” “[t]itle to your Digital Assets shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to FTX;” and “none of the digital assets in your account are the property of, or shall or may be loaned to, FTX Trading.” The Terms of Service further provided: “Once we receive fiat currency we may issue you an equivalent amount of electronic money (“E-Money”)…which represents the fiat currency that you have loaded” and “[y]ou may redeem all or part of any E-Money held in your Account at any time.”
. Similarly, FTX posted on its website a document entitled, “FTX’s Key Principles for Ensuring Investor Protections on Digital-Asset Platforms,” in which FTX represented that it “segregates customer assets from its own assets across our platforms.” FTX further represented in that document that it maintained “liquid assets for customer withdrawals…[to] ensure a customer without losses can redeem its assets from the platform on demand.”
. In addition to making this document available to the public on its website, FTX specifically provided it to potential investors, including a U.S. investor who had invested $35 million in FTX’s Series B fundraising round in July 2021. As described above, these statements to the public, customers, and investors were false—FTX did not segregate its customer assets from its own assets, and, as events would later demonstrate, did not maintain liquidity to allow customer withdrawals on demand.
. FTX investors were provided with FTX’s audited financial statements, and FTX represented in its purchase agreements that those financial statements “fairly present in all material respects the financial condition and operating results of” FTX. These audited financial statements, which do not include information about Alameda’s undocumented “line of credit” from FTX and other information discussed herein, were, at the very least, materially misleading. Indeed, FTX’s current CEO has voiced “substantial concern as to the information presented in
these audited financial statements.”
. Throughout the Relevant Period, Bankman-Fried made public statements assuring that customer assets were safe at FTX. For example, he stated in a tweet on or about June 27, 2022: “Backstopping customer assets should always be primary. Everything else is secondary.” He likewise tweeted on or about August 9, 2021: “As always, our users’ funds and safety comes first. We will always allow withdrawals (except in cases of suspected money laundering/theft/etc.).”
. Bankman-Fried also told investors, and directed other FTX and Alameda employees to tell investors, that Alameda received no preferential treatment from FTX. For example, Bankman-Fried told the Wall Street Journal in or around July 2022: “There are no parties that have privileged access.” Likewise, in a Bloomberg article published in or about September 2022, Bankman-Fried claimed that “Alameda is a wholly separate entity” than FTX. In the same article, Ellison is quoted as stating about Alameda: “We’re at arm’s length and don’t get any different treatment from other market makers.” Similarly, in an interview in or about August 2022, Ellison claimed that FTX and Alameda were separate companies, that Alameda received no special treatment on the FTX platform, and that there was an ethical wall between them preventing sharing of customer information between FTX and Alameda. Bankman-Fried made similar statements directly to investors.
. Defendants were aware of the substance of Bankman-Fried’s statements about FTX customer assets—including the security of the assets and the manner in which they would be handled—and about the relationship between Alameda and FTX. Given their involvement in the fraudulent scheme outlined herein, Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that these statements to investors were false and misleading and that they were important to FTX’s investors. Defendants further knew or were reckless in not knowing that these statements were intended to make FTX more attractive to investors and potential investors. 

[upperalpha, start=3]
. [underline]#**Defendants Knew that FTX Had Poor Controls and Deeply Inadequate Risk Management Procedures, in Stark Contrast to Bankman-Fried’s Claims that It Was a Mature, Conservative Company.**#

[start=59]
. From its inception, FTX had poor controls and fundamentally deficient risk management procedures. Assets and liabilities of all forms were generally treated as interchangeable, and there were insufficient distinctions between the assignment of debts and credits to Alameda, FTX, and executives, including Bankman-Fried, Wang, and Singh. This reality was a sharp contrast to the image of FTX that Bankman-Fried consistently portrayed to the public and to investors—a mature company that managed funds and risk in a conservative, rigorous manner.
. FTX invested significant resources to develop and promote its brand as a trustworthy company. For example, in materials provided to one investor in or around June 2022, FTX cultivated and promoted its reputation:
[none]
** FTX has an industry-leading brand, endorsed by some of the most trustworthy public figures, including Tom Brady, MLB, Gisele Bundchen, Steph Curry, and the Miami Heat, and backed by an industry-leading set of investors. FTX has the leanest brand in crypto.
. FTX also promoted itself as a company that was willing to work collaboratively with regulators and lawmakers. In the same materials, FTX claimed: “FTX is also the only major digital asset venue to maintain positive, constructive relationships with regulators and lawmakers.”
. Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that the reality was far different than what Bankman-Fried presented to FTX’s investors and customers.

[lowerroman, start=1]
. **The FTX Automated Risk Engine**

[start=63]
. Bankman-Fried repeatedly touted FTX’s automated risk mitigation protocols— which he called FTX’s “risk engine”—to the public, and prospective investors, as a safe and reliable way for crypto asset trading platforms to manage risk. FTX engineers, led by Wang, developed the software code that created the “risk engine.” In essence, the software code implemented a series of rules that were designed to reduce risk in any individual client’s account by automatically triggering certain actions (e.g., to sell collateral in an account when an account was overly extended).
. Bankman-Fried promoted the concept of “24/7” automated risk monitoring as an innovative benefit of crypto asset markets, including at a hearing on or about December 8, 2021, to the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services, where Bankman-Fried concluded his remarks by stating:
[none]
** And the last thing I will say is if you look at what precipitated some of the 2008 financial crisis, you will see a number of bilateral, bespoke, non-reported transactions happening between financial counterparties, which then got repackaged and releveraged again and again and again, such that no one knew how much risk was in that system until it all fell apart. If you compare that to what happened on FTX or other major cryptocurrencies in use today, there is complete transparency about the full open interest. There is complete transparency about the positions that are held. There is a robust, consistent risk framework applied. 
. In addition to generally promoting the benefits of automated risk engines, Bankman-Fried repeatedly claimed that FTX’s own risk engine was especially sophisticated and carefully calibrated. In a submission to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, FTX touted its automated system, claiming that it calculated a customer’s margin level every 30 seconds; and that if the collateral on deposit fell below the required margin level, FTX’s automated system would sell the customer’s portfolio assets until the collateral on deposit exceeded the required margin level.
. These statements were materially false and misleading because of a critical omission: Bankman-Fried did not reveal that the automatic risk engine did not apply to the accounts of its most important customer—Alameda. As discussed above, Wang and other FTX engineers—as part of Defendants’ and Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent scheme—had created a special feature in the software code to exempt Alameda from the rules of the “risk engine.” This was a critical special benefit that Bankman-Fried afforded Alameda: Alameda’s collateral on deposit was allowed to fall below FTX’s required margin level without FTX liquidating any part of Alameda’s portfolio. Ellison was aware of, and took advantage of, this special undisclosed benefit.
. Defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Bankman-Fried’s statements regarding FTX’s risk engine misled FTX’s investors by representing that its risk engine would protect FTX customer funds and would limit FTX’s exposure to any single customer, while failing to disclose that Bankman-Fried had directed Wang to ensure that the engine not apply to one of its largest customers.
. As Bankman-Fried acknowledged in a network television interview on or about December 1, 2022: “I wasn’t even trying, like, I wasn’t spending any time or effort trying to manage risk on FTX.” Bankman-Fried continued: “What happened, happened—and, if I had been spending an hour a day thinking about risk management on FTX, I don’t think that would have happened.”

[lowerroman, start=2]
. *The Valuation of Alameda’s Collateral*

[start=69]
. The collateral that Alameda had on deposit, consisting largely of enormous positions in illiquid crypto assets issued by FTX and Bankman-Fried (including the “FTT” token, the “exchange token” for FTX, as described below), compounded the undisclosed risk to FTX’s investors.
[loweralpha]
.. Alameda Overvalued Its Collateral by Ignoring Significant Liquidity Issues.
. Defendants and Bankman-Fried valued the FTX-affiliated tokens at trading prices, but the collateral deposited by Alameda was not worth the value assigned to it. Alameda and FTX collectively owned the majority of these tokens, and only a small portion of the FTXaffiliated tokens were in circulation. As such, the tokens were illiquid, and, as Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing, if Alameda or FTX tried to sell Alameda’s holdings, market prices for the tokens would fall, thereby driving down the value of Alameda’s deposited collateral at FTX. As a result, even if FTX had liquidated Alameda’s portfolio, the sales of those thinly traded tokens would not have generated sufficient funds to cover the amount Alameda borrowed from FTX.
. Defendants and Bankman-Fried were well aware of the impact of Alameda’s positions on FTX’s risk profile. On or about October 12, 2022, for example, Bankman-Fried, in a series of tweets, analyzed the manipulation of a digital asset on an unrelated crypto platform. In explaining what occurred, Bankman-Fried distinguished between an asset’s “current price” and its “fair price,” and recognized that “large positions – especially in illiquid tokens – can have a lot of impact.” Bankman-Fried asserted that FTX’s risk engine required customers to “fully collateralize a position” when the customer’s position is “large and illiquid enough.” But Bankman-Fried knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that by not mitigating for the impact of large and illiquid tokens posted as collateral by Alameda, FTX was engaging in precisely the same conduct, and creating the same risk, that he was warning against. Defendants too knew that Alameda was drawing down on a virtually unlimited line of credit from FTX, collateralized by what they knew or were reckless in not knowing was a large illiquid position.
. The reality of FTX’s exposure to the risk created by the valuation of Alameda’s positions stood in stark contrast to Bankman-Fried’s assertions about risk management at FTX in his October 2022 Twitter analysis, in which he described FTX’s approach and claimed that constructing the rules for FTX’s risk engine in a manner that is “conservative, and handles apparent large moves gracefully” is “probably the most important thing we do at FTX.” Bankman-Fried further claimed, contrasting FTX to the failed endeavor: “There are a bunch of other risk engine protection and sanity checks, too, which would have caught something like this.”
. Not only did Bankman-Fried fail to tell investors that he had exempted Alameda from FTX’s risk engine, he also falsely told certain investors that FTX had no exposure to FTT at all. In late summer 2021, for example, Bankman-Fried told a potential U.S. investor in FTX’s series B fundraising round that FTX did not hold FTT and, consequently, the investor would not have any exposure to FTT. The investor ultimately invested $30 million. For the reasons
described above, Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing that at the time that Bankman-Fried made those representations, they were false and misleading.Specifically, Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing that any investment in FTX carried significant exposure to FTT, as the token was, among other things, posted as collateral for billions of dollars that FTX had loaned to Alameda to engage in
speculative investments. 
[loweralpha, start=2]
.. Alameda Manipulated the Market Price of FTT and, as a Result, Further Inflated the Value of Its Collateral.
. Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, caused Alameda to manipulate the price of
FTT by purchasing large quantities of FTT on the open market to prop up its price. This
manipulative activity was in furtherance of Defendants’ scheme because it allowed Ellison and
Alameda to engage in further borrowing, while concealing Alameda’s true risk exposure.
[numeric]
.. [underline]#FTT Was Offered and Sold as an Investment Contract and, Therefore, as a Security.#
. On or about July 29, 2019, FTX launched a crypto asset known as “FTT.” xref:#ellison_wang_footnote_5[*^_(5)_^*] FTX launched FTT as an “exchange token” for the FTX platform (i.e., the crypto asset or token associated with a crypto trading platform).
. Before launching the FTX platform in or around May 2019, FTX had minted 350 million FTT tokens in or around April 2019. Of the 350 million tokens minted, 175 million were allocated to FTX as “company tokens,” and 175 million were designated as non-company tokens. The company tokens were set to “unlock” (or become available for trading) over a threeyear period after a so-called initial exchange offering (“IEO”) of the token.
. From the time of its offering, FTT was offered and sold as an investment contract and therefore a security.
. Of the 175 million non-company tokens, FTX offered and sold approximately 73 million FTT in so-called “pre-sales” to investors, at prices ranging from $0.10 to $0.80. FTX raised approximately $10 million from these sales of FTT prior to the IEO. The pre-sale tokens were programmed to unlock between one to three months after the IEO. FTX did not manage separate, segregated accounts for investors, but instead pooled all proceeds from the pre-sale and the IEO of FTT and treated them interchangeably.
. FTX used the pooled proceeds from FTT sales to fund the development, marketing, business operations, and growth of FTX, depending on the success of FTX and its management team in developing, operating, and marketing the trading platform. If demand for trading on the FTX platform increased, demand for the FTT token could increase, such that any price increase in FTT would benefit holders of FTT equally and in direct proportion to their FTT holdings. The large allocation of tokens to FTX incentivized the FTX management team to take steps to attract more users onto the trading platform and, therefore, increase demand for, and increase the trading price of, the FTT token.
. As a result of FTX and its management team’s large holdings of FTT, the interests of the company and its management team were aligned with those of investors in FTT. 
. FTX’s FTT marketing materials—consisting of an FTT “whitepaper” and information posted on FTX’s website—described FTT as “the token powering the FTX ecosystem.” The publicly available information led FTT holders to reasonably expect to share in FTX’s growth and future earnings, and from appreciation in the value of FTT.
. The FTT whitepaper specifically highlighted the profit potential of the token. For example, the whitepaper included the following statements: “We launched FTX in April and already have among the world’s most liquid orderbooks” and “[o]ur goal is to become as profitable as Bitmex and OkEx within a year.” On the FTX website, FTT purchasers were offered a 5% bonus of tokens during the first three days of the IEO if they pre-funded their FTX wallets to purchase FTT, providing a potential immediate profit to investors. FTX also represented that FTT would be listed at $1.00 on July 29, 2019, and the “pre-sales” were at prices ranging from $0.10 to $0.80, which provided purchasers an immediate profit potential based on the announced listing price.
. The FTX whitepaper further explained: “We have carefully designed incentive schemes to increase network effects and demand for FTT, and to decrease its circulating supply.” The FTT materials stated that the token provided investors with fee rebates and discounts on FTX, and the ability to use the token as collateral for futures positions as well as for “margin trading” that FTX promised to launch “in the future.” The FTT materials referred to potential gains from FTX’s future repurchase and burning of FTT (the “buy and burn” program), to be funded by FTX’s revenues.xref:#ellison_wang_footnote_6[*^_(6)_^*]
. The FTX whitepaper also explained that “[c]ustomers who hold a certain amount of FTT for a period of time will receive lower FTX futures fees” and that this “will further increase demand for FTT.”
. FTT was marketed as an investment that would appreciate in value as it grew and expanded in other ways. FTX represented that it “carefully designed incentive schemes to increase network effects and demand for FTT, and to decrease its circulating supply.” These incentives included that FTT would be listed on FTX and thus could be traded, and FTX’s “buy and burn” program would purchase FTT, thus boosting demand, and then burn those purchased tokens in order to decrease the supply of FTT and increase its price.
. FTX marketed FTT by encouraging purchasers to believe that its platform would succeed and provide a return based on that success. The FTT whitepaper emphasized “Why Invest? -- All-Star Team,” and highlighted the importance of the management team’s experience and success in developing crypto asset trading systems. For example, the whitepaper stated that FTX’s “greatest strength lies in the team behind it” and touted FTX’s “Track Record of Proven Success” based on the background and experience of its management team. The FTT materials made clear that FTX’s core management team’s efforts would drive the growth and ultimate success of FTX. The whitepaper also advertised that certain features gave FTX an advantage over competing platforms, including industry-leading risk management systems and its liquidation engine model.
. FTX also marketed FTT as an asset that could be used in an “earn program” or in “staking programs” (i.e., a program promising interest payments on deposited assets), as additional ways in which investors could earn returns from FTT.
. FTX’s whitepaper tied the prospects of FTT’s investors to the growth of the FTX platform, and noted that FTX would undertake various “Strategies to Acquire Users and Grow Volume,” including the employment of influential spokespeople.
. FTX’s whitepaper also stated that “[t]here are many ways FTT will be used as we add more products and features to FTX. For instance, when we launch a spot exchange in the future, FTT will be used for initial exchange offerings.”
. As a result of the above representations and the economic reality at that time, FTT investors had a reasonable expectation of profiting from FTX’s efforts to deploy investor funds to create a use for FTT and bring demand and value to their common enterprise.

.. [underline]#Alameda and Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s Direction, Manipulated the Market Price of FTT.#
. In July 2019, when FTX launched FTT, Alameda received a substantial portion of the 350 million FTT tokens that were minted, including all of the “company tokens” that were allocated to FTX. Alameda did not pay for these tokens
. Alameda programmed its automated trading tools (or “bots”) to conduct trades and execute transactions to purchase FTT at specific prices. On more than one occasion, Alameda and Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, actively engaged in the trading of FTT with the goal of supporting the price of the token. On these occasions, Alameda adjusted the trading parameters of its trading bots in order to support the price of FTT.
. For example, in 2019, there was downward pressure on the price of FTT as the token was being unlocked for early-stage investors. Bankman-Fried became concerned about, among other things, the psychological effect of the price of FTT dropping below a specific threshold, and instructed Ellison to have Alameda purchase FTT to support the price and avoid that outcome. In another instance in 2021, the price of FTT was again facing downward pressure from external events, this time related to substantial sales of FTT by a third party. Bankman-Fried again instructed Ellison to have Alameda purchase FTT on trading platforms to support the price. In addition, as described further below in paragraph 106, in November 2022, Ellison engaged in further deceptive conduct to support the price of FTT.
. By manipulating the price of FTT, Ellison and Bankman-Fried caused the valuation of Alameda’s FTT holdings to be even more inflated. As described above, Alameda’s FTT holdings were a substantial part of the collateral Alameda used to borrow funds from external lenders. By overstating the value of the collateral on Alameda’s balance sheet, Ellison and Bankman-Fried concealed Alameda’s true risk exposure from those lenders, and misled investors about FTX’s risk exposure—all in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme.
[lower roman, start=3]
.. **Loans to FTX Executives and Real Estate Purchases**
. The FTX funds transferred to Alameda were used not only for Alameda’s proprietary trading, but also to fund loans to FTX executives, including Bankman-Fried himself, and to fund personal real estate purchases. Between March 2020 and September 2022, Bankman-Fried executed promissory notes for loans from Alameda totaling more than $1.338 billion, including two instances in which Bankman-Fried was both the borrower in his individual capacity and the lender in his capacity as CEO of Alameda. Ellison knew, or was reckless in not knowing, about these “loans.”
. Bankman-Fried also used commingled funds from Alameda to make large political donations and to purchase tens of millions of dollars in Bahamian real estate for himself, his parents, and other FTX executives. Specifically, in 2020 and 2021, Wang executed promissory notes with Alameda totaling approximately $224.7 million. The funds borrowed under the promissory notes in Wang’s name were not intended for Wang’s personal use but were instead used by Bankman-Fried for other purposes, including additional venture investments. However, Wang did withdraw approximately $200,000 in funds for his own purposes.
. The loans to Bankman-Fried, Wang, and other individuals were poorly documented, and at times not documented at all. Similarly, the record keeping regarding the purchase and ownership of real estate was poorly organized and documented. Defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that neither the fact of the loans and purchases, nor the poor documentation of significant company liabilities and expenditures, was disclosed to investors.

. [underline]#**Despite the Precarious Financial Position of FTX and Alameda, Bankman-Fried and Ellison Continued to Use FTX Customer Assets in the Summer of 2022, Including to Rescue Distressed Crypto Firms and to Further Mislead Investors.**#

[start=98]
. In May 2022, the crypto markets plummeted due to a significant loss in value of certain crypto assets and networks and the collateral effects on the interrelated markets. Bankman-Fried characterized FTX, and himself, as playing an important role in stabilizing the industry. Bankman-Fried entered into a series of transactions with other members of  the industry, providing credit to and taking over other failing firms. On or about June 21, 2022, after giving a $250 million line of revolving credit to BlockFi, a global crypto financial services company, to provide the company with access to capital to ease liquidity concerns, Bankman-Fried tweeted: “We take our duty seriously to protect the digital asset ecosystem and its customers.”
. At the same time that Bankman-Fried was positioning himself as a hero in the industry, however, the plummeting value of crypto assets was impacting Alameda, and as a result impacting FTX. As discussed above, as a result of the same market conditions impacting BlockFi’s liquidity, many of Alameda’s lenders demanded repayment of loans they had made to
Alameda. Ellison, at the direction of Bankman-Fried, drew down billions of dollars from its “line of credit” from FTX to repay some of Alameda’s loans—money that came from FTX’s spot market funded by FTX customers.
. Thus, in the summer of 2022, Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that FTX was in a precarious financial condition. However, Bankman-Fried and Ellison, with Wang’s knowledge, continued to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase and support other crypto companies, and allowed Alameda to use FTX customer funds
to repay its debts. In addition, Bankman-Fried, Wang, and other FTX executives continued to withdraw customer funds in the form of the poorly documented and undisclosed “loans” described above. Specifically, on or about July 22, 2022, Bankman-Fried loaned himself $136 million and, on or about September 28, 2022, Wang signed a promissory note to Alameda for $13.7 million, which was used by Bankman-Fried for a venture investment. Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew, or were reckless in not knowing, of the significant financial risk these “loans” posed to both Alameda and FTX. Collectively, Defendants’ and Bankman-Fried’s actions in the summer of 2022 further imperiled FTX’s financial condition.
. Defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that Bankman-Fried continued to present a false and misleading positive account of FTX to investors, despite FTX’s tenuous financial condition at this time. In a meeting with FTX’s U.S. investors in September 2022, for example, an FTX presentation included the claim that: “Outside of BlockFi, we didn’t increase our exposure to crypto.” This statement was false and misleading: the customer funds that FTX diverted to Alameda, including customer funds that Ellison used to repay Alameda’s lenders, were collateralized in part by Alameda’s FTT holdings. Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing that, as a result, FTX’s exposure to crypto, including its own FTT token, increased substantially as Alameda increased its borrowing, backed by FTT as collateral, in the second quarter of 2022.
. In that same meeting with FTX investors, FTX also represented that certain investments did not involve the assets of FTX or its customers. Contrary to that representation, two $100 million investments made by FTX’s affiliated investment vehicle, FTX Ventures Ltd., were funded with FTX customer funds that had been diverted to Alameda.

[upperalpha, start=5]
. [underline]#**Even as the Scheme Was Spiraling Out of Control, Bankman-Fried and Ellison, with Wang’s Knowledge, Continued to Mislead Investors and the Public About FTX’s True Financial Condition.**#

[start=103]
. On or about November 2, 2022, CoinDesk, a crypto news website, published an
article stating that based on its review of an Alameda balance sheet it had obtained, Alameda
held a large position in FTT and other FTX-associated tokens. At Bankman-Fried’s direction,
Ellison responded on Twitter to reassure investors and the public that Alameda was financially
sound. Ellison did so on or about November 6, 2022, tweeting that the balance sheet referenced
in the CoinDesk article (and elsewhere by that point) “is for a subset of our corporate entities, we
have > $10 billion of assets that aren’t reflected there.” Ellison continued: “…given the
tightening in the crypto credit space this year we’ve returned most of our loans by now.” The
tweet was designed to provide false reassurance to customers by implying that Alameda had
additional assets that meant its financial condition was stronger than the balance sheet suggested.
At the same time, the tweet omitted the fact that the balance sheet did not accurately reflect the
significant debt that Alameda owed to FTX. In contrast to the positive message in her tweet, at
that point, Ellison knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Alameda was insolvent.
. On or about November 6, 2022, the CEO of Binance, a crypto asset trading
platform, announced that “[d]ue to recent revelations that have came [sic] to light,” Binance
would liquidate its FTT holdings. Binance held FTT then valued at more than $500 million,
which it had received from FTX as part of Bankman-Fried’s buyout of Binance’s equity in FTX
as an early round investor.
. Binance’s announcement caused many FTX customers to withdraw their funds
from FTX. Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing that given
Alameda’s large FTT holdings, any further drop in the value of FTT threatened the solvency of
FTX, given Alameda’s multi-billion-dollar liabilities. With the knowledge and consent of the
Defendants, Bankman-Fried engaged in a frantic campaign to prevent this outcome by assuring
investors and the public that FTX was financially sound.
. Specifically, to prevent a collapse in the market price of FTT that Binance’s sales
might cause, Ellison, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, tweeted an offer to buy Binance’s entire
stake, for $22 per token (“@cz_binance if you’re looking to minimize the market impact on your
FTT sales, Alameda will happily buy it all from you today at $22!”). When Ellison sent this
message she knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that in order for Alameda to be able to
actually purchase Binance’s FTT for $22 per token, Alameda would have to draw down
additional funds from FTX itself, further extending its line of credit, or obtain funds from thirdparty
lenders without disclosing its own tenuous financial condition. Despite this, Ellison posted
the tweet in an effort to support and increase the price of FTT, again using Alameda to impact
the price of FTT in furtherance of Defendants’ scheme.
. Similarly, attempting to maintain public and investor confidence in FTX,
Bankman-Fried tweeted on or about November 7, 2022: “FTX is fine. Assets are fine … FTX
has enough to cover all client holdings. We don’t invest client assets (even in treasuries). We
have been processing all withdrawals, and will continue to be ….” That tweet was false and
misleading, and Bankman-Fried later deleted it. Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew that FTX,
at Bankman-Fried’s direction, had allowed Alameda to invest “client assets” and that Alameda
had in fact done so, using FTX customer funds to make investments far riskier than “treasuries.”
. The next day, November 8, 2022, FTX paused all customer withdrawals, and the
price of FTT plummeted by approximately 80%. Alameda’s collateral on deposit was worth far
less than the amount Alameda had borrowed from FTX. FTX was left with billions of dollars in
effectively unrecoverable loans.
. Facing a solvency crisis, Bankman-Fried searched for investors who could
provide additional funding. On or about November 8, 2022, the CEO of Binance tweeted: “FTX
asked for our help. There is a significant liquidity crunch. To protect users, we signed a nonbinding
LOI, intending to fully acquire http://FTX.com and help cover the liquidity crunch. We
will be conducting a full DD [due diligence] in the coming days.”
. It only took one day, however, for Binance to decide not to acquire FTX. On or
about November 9, Binance announced: “As a result of corporate due diligence, as well as the
latest news reports regarding mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations,
we have decided that we will not pursue the potential acquisition of http://FTX.com.”
. FTX customers withdrew approximately $5 billion from the platform that day.
. At the same time, Bankman-Fried sought emergency funding from other
investors, including U.S. investors, to cover a shortfall at FTX of approximately $8 billion. As
part of this effort, Bankman-Fried circulated a balance sheet to potential investors that listed a
negative $8 billion entry labeled as a “hidden, poorly internally labeled ‘fiat@ account.’” This
entry was a reference to the above-described fiat@ftx.com account and reflected FTX customer
funds deposited in Alameda’s bank accounts.
. During a meeting with Alameda employees on or about November 9, 2022,
Ellison admitted that she, Bankman-Fried, Wang, and Singh were aware that FTX customer
funds had been used by Alameda.
. On the morning of November 10, 2022, confronting the implosion of FTX and
Alameda, Bankman-Fried tweeted: “1) I’m sorry. That’s the biggest thing. I f*cked up, and
should have done better.”xref:ellison_wang_footnote_7[*^_(7)_^*] In the same tweet thread, Bankman-Fried announced that Alameda was “winding down trading” and soon would not trade on FTX at all. Bankman-Fried
maintained that “FTX International currently has a total market value of assets/collateral higher
than client deposits (moves with prices!).” And he stated, among other things, that he was trying
to “raise liquidity,” claiming “[t]here are a number of players who we are in talks with, LOIs
[letters of intent], term sheets, etc.”
. The next day, November 11, 2022, Bankman-Fried resigned from FTX. Shortly thereafter, FTX and approximately 100 affiliated entities, including FTX US, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Wang’s employment with FTX and Ellison’s employment with Alameda were terminated on or about November 18, 2022.

|[[ellison_wang_footnote_1]]
`1`. Bankman-Fried was charged by the Commission on December 13, 2022, in Securities and Exchange Commission v. Samuel Bankman-Fried, 22-cv-10501 (S.D.N.Y.). The allegations herein are focused on the conduct and knowledge of Ellison and Wang, as well as Bankman-Fried. Other individuals were both aware of and participated in some aspects of the fraud scheme described herein.
|[[ellison_wang_footnote_2]]
`2`. Ellison served as CEO of Alameda Research Ltd., a subsidiary of Alameda Research LLC. For clarity, as set forth
in paragraph 17, the complaint refers to Alameda Research LLC and its subsidiaries collectively as “Alameda.”
|[[ellison_wang_footnote_3]]
`3`. Crypto assets are unique digital assets maintained on a cryptographically-secured blockchain. A blockchain or distributed ledger is a peer-to-peer database spread across a network of computers that records all transactions in theoretically unchangeable, digitally recorded data packages. The system relies on cryptographic techniques for secure recording of transactions. Crypto tokens may be traded on crypto asset trading platforms in exchange for other crypto assets or fiat currency (legal tender issued by a country).
|[[ellison_wang_footnote_4]]
`4`. FTX US is the d/b/a for a subsidiary of West Realm Shires Inc., a separate legal entity from FTX Trading Ltd. that provided different services. FTX US’s conduct is not the subject of the allegations in this complaint. 
|[[ellison_wang_footnote_5]]
`5`. FTT was available for trading on FTX, but not on FTX US. 
|[[ellison_wang_footnote_6]]
`6`. Generally speaking, “exchange tokens” purport to provide incentives, benefits, and investment returns to holders and to traders on crypto asset trading platforms. For example, “exchange tokens” may offer fee discounts with respect to crypto asset trading platform fees, or offer other benefits, essentially incentivizing the platform’s traders or users to allocate additional funds to the platform’s ecosystem. Trading platforms may also offer “exchange tokens” to their customers in exchange for the customers bringing trading liquidity or other customers or funds to the platform.
|[[ellison_wang_footnote_7]]
`7`. Expletives have been redacted in part with asterisks.
